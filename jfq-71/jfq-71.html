Together we will continue to protect our nation and honor our profession.</p><p style="padding-left: 183pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Over the past 2 years, we have served together on the leading edge of historic changes. We are transitioning from two conflicts and rekindling the skills necessary to provide options against a broad range</p><p style="padding-left: 183pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of threats. We are transitioning tens of thousands of our veterans and their families back into their civilian communities. We are dealing with the reality of deep and rapid budgetary transitions as well. We’re going</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to see what we’re made of in the months and years ahead.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">When <i>Joint Force Quarterly </i>published its first issue in the summer of 1993, it featured a military leader who was in the midst of dealing with the transitions of</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">his era. General Colin Powell wrote of his time as Chairman, “Walls have come down, empires have crumbled, new nations have been born.”</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">We recall those days when the Cold War ended. The Joint Force had performed brilliantly in Operation <i>Desert Storm</i>, but those of us who served in that conflict</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="989" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">realized that Service coordination and interoperability still needed to improve. As just one example, it was in <i>Desert Storm </i>that I first operated in a joint environment, and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">I had been in the Army for 15 years. Today, we know a lot more about each other, and we operate together far more effectively. Truly, the walls have come down. We are more joint today, but not yet joint enough.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">We will continue to explore the oppor- tunities for increased jointness because we should and because we will have to if we are to provide the range of options necessary to protect the Nation in uncertain security and fiscal environments.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">It is also worth noting that the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1993, Admiral David Jeremiah, described the post–Cold War world as “teeming with nascent crises.” I have described today’s world as more dangerous than at any time in my career because of the increasing number of actors—state and nonstate—that can do us harm. In any case, no matter how we describe the security environment, it will be the enduring quality and dedication of our Servicemembers that will allow us to prevail.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, and Coastguardsmen are serving together today all over the world. General Powell’s maxim that “we train as a team, fight as a team, and win as a team” is even truer today. As we confront competing security priorities and declining resources, we cannot short-change our commitment to jointness either in train- ing or in operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Leadership got the Joint Force through its post–Cold War challenges 20 years ago, and it will get us through today’s challenges as well.

We will be tested.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">I have been asked often whether I  think we can manage all of the challenges we will continue to face.

The required readings included a chapter</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">from Fred Iklé’s seminal work, <i>Every War Must End </i>(Columbia University Press, 1971). Dr. Iklé initially published this book as the United States was looking for an exit from the Vietnam War. This classroom reading was a part of what turned out to be a timely and spirited discussion as the drawdown of forces in Afghanistan continues and events unfold around the likely U.S. response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons on its own citizens.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">General Colin Powell credits <i>Every War Must End </i>with giving him an understand- ing of how to end the first Gulf War. In his revision of the work published in 2005, Dr. Iklé criticized Washington’s handling of the Iraq War. He identifies the hard questions that all parties involved in a conflict wrestle with, including determining what the goal is, how it can be achieved, and when will it be obvious that end has arrived. Dr. Iklé offers many historical cases to show the complexity of war as viewed from many vantage points, including the parliaments and chateaus of World War I, the end of war with Japan, the geostrategic challenges in the 1950–1953 Korean War, the secret negotiations in Paris during the Vietnam War, and more.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As with every good book, the author must have a main purpose for writing it. I believe that Dr. Iklé works hard to provide the insight that both civilian and military strategists and planners rarely spend as much time working on how to end a war as they do on beginning one. His examples are plentiful enough to describe this condition as one that is historically true for more than just Americans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">But more than <i>identifying </i>the problem, Dr. Iklé places the burden of seeking to limit war on the world’s “leading democracies .</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">. . to create a new political order” with “the purpose of this endeavor to bring every war to an end without unleashing the cataclysmic destruction made possible by modern tech- nology.”<span class="s64">1</span><span class="s65"> </span>His concern was over the remaining size of the nuclear, biological, and chemical stockpiles that we still recognize as a global threat. After some 20 years, the democratic nations of the world are again wrestling with the primary strategy equation of ends, ways, and means—mixing in a good amount of technology along the way as we collectively seek order in this unsettled world. <i>Joint Force Quarterly </i>seeks to publish thoughtful articles that should help the reader find insight in how best to meet the continuing challenges the new world order brings.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In this edition’s Forum, we present four valuable views that offer you the opportunity to consider new uses for existing capabilities in order to calculate the resource implica- tions and review legal issues emerging from combat operations in Kosovo, Iraq, Afghani- stan, and Libya. Given the current entropic global environment, these authors provide</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a diverse set of views on modern warfare, which we believe are essential reading. One of the evolving capabilities of the joint force resides with the U.S. and coalition partner airborne forces. Major General John Nich- olson, Lieutenant Colonel Jason Condrey, and Major Claude Lambert explain how the forcible entry capability, resident within  the joint force and growing in our partners, remains a requirement to assure forces can gain access to conflict areas when required. They also discuss the value added interna- tionally when U.S. airborne forces provide</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">essential training to our partners as a means</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to more effectively deal with global crises as they arise.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Next, from the National War College, Ambassador Gregory Schulte takes us back to a time just before the current period</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of war by discussing the Kosovo air war’s strategic lessons. Having been at the center of American air power employment at</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the start of the Libyan campaign, Major General Margaret Woodward and Lieuten- ant Colonel Philip Morrison next provide the logic behind that effort to protect civil- ian populations, while engaged in a similar effort a decade later. On the domestic politi- cal front, as the White House seeks congres- sional approval prior to any military action in Syria, James Terry’s article on Libya and the War Powers Act should be placed at the top of any serious policymaker’s must-read list. Collectively, these articles offer a sig- nificant set of considerations given the situ- ation in relation to what the United States might do militarily to respond to Syrian attacks on its population. It is rare that <i>JFQ </i>is able to offer such important thinking at the moment such events unfold, but this is exactly what we hope to do when we are able.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">This edition next presents the 2013 7<span class="s60">t</span><span class="s61">h </span>Annual Secretary of Defense and 32<span class="s60">nd</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Annual Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Essay Competition winners in each of the three categories.

This edi- tion’s Commentary section has a wealth of great thoughts from both on the constantly evolving world of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, the value of strategy, and how best to organize the joint force for effective employment as we go forward. On the ISR front, General Robert Cone calls for a restructuring of how the U.S. Army is organized at the opera- tional level to take advantage of the experi- ences of the last decade war and to ensure the joint force and the Army are best posi- tioned to exploit the advantages that recon- naissance and surveillance provide beyond the tactical fight. He suggests that even as the Army shrinks, this deeper and higher level integration is critical to determining enemy intent over time. Andrew Robert Marvin develops new approaches to how ISR could be effectively tailored to address the operational problems inherent in joint force employment to locations where adversaries are prepared to present commanders and units with antiaccess/area-denial issues.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Dr. Colin Gray follows up his popular article published in <i>JFQ </i>67 on strategists as heroes with his views on strategy focusing on five perspectives that include concepts, ethics, culture, geography, and technology. As always with Professor Gray’s writing, there is something for everyone interested in the subject to contemplate. If seeking to understand strategy remains high on your list of necessary tasks, then Professor Daniel McCauley offers a set of important ideas</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on how to deal with the complexities of the globalized world in which the joint force must operate.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In the Features section, we have three discussions focused on how we can continue to develop the joint force as we assist host nations in building for a better future and two perspectives in the on-going debate on missile defense in Europe. Drawing on the Iraq experience, Dr. Keith Boyer and Lieuten- ant General Robert Allardice, USAF (Ret.), provide a good primer on how to assist a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">host nation in building better governance beginning with improving its ministerial capacity. Next, Lieutenant General Robert Caslen, Colonel Dean Raab, and Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Adams present a set of useful recommendations for improving joint security cooperation doctrine, as well as the requisite authorities needed to execute this critical mission. Security cooperation and host nation capacity-building have not been without their own sets of risks. The recurring problem of host forces attacking coalition forces, especially in a training setting (so called “green-on-blue” attacks), is the subject of Eric Jardine’s article, which looks into why</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">examines the strategic leadership lessons we can take from the infamous Ludendorff Offensives of 1918.

As always, we bring you three important book reviews that we hope you will find useful.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As I have mentioned in an earlier edition of <i>JFQ</i>, change is a constant and nowhere more so recently than here at NDU Press. One of our longest serving staff members, George Maerz, retired this spring</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">after more than 40 years of U.S. Government service, most of which was with National Defense University and NDU Press. George was the lead editor on thousands of pages of national and international security writing produced by students and scholars as well as from national and internationally renowned thinkers and doers. All of us who have ben- efited from his work owe George thanks for all of the quiet excellence he added to every page he touched.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">We continue to look ahead for new and engaging writing on issues important to the joint force, and I encourage you to find the time to write and engage us in a conversa- tion about the world you see ahead. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="220" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_010.png"/></span></p><p class="s66" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">—William t.

However, the contrary is more likely, with scenarios that could arise from traditional state-based military threats, “disorder” from intrastate conflict and failing governments, transnational threats, violent extremist orga- nizations, disasters, and hybrid combina- tions. Clearly, most of these circumstances, particularly those involving the loss of control of weapons of mass destruction or the protection of threatened American lives or interests, will require the rapid introduc- tion of ground forces, employed in uncertain to nonpermissive conditions as part of a suite of interdependent joint force capabilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Fiscal constraints increasingly limit overseas basing options and access to volatile regions. As a result, our adversaries will employ asymmetric capabilities and antiaccess/area-denial (A2/AD) strategies in the global commons and possible operating areas to limit, delay, or degrade the employ- ment of joint and coalition forces. Conse- quently, ground forces employed in crisis response scenarios must be agile, responsive, and capable of JFE, operational maneuver from strategic distance, fighting imme- diately on arrival to seize lodgments, and exploiting the initiative gained when our air and naval partners defeat the in-depth A2/ AD efforts of our adversaries.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">To ensure a robust and credible crisis response capability, the Department of Defense (DOD) directed the establishment of a joint Global Response Force (GRF), and the Army’s contributions are centered on the unique capabilities of the 82<span class="s60">n</span><span class="s61">d </span>Airborne Division—rapidly deployable, forcible entry capable, tailorable in composition, scalable in size, adaptable to multiple missions, and always at a high state of readiness.

It does so in full recognition that this is an inherently joint mission requiring the regeneration of core competencies to guarantee the capabili- ties necessary to conduct airborne JFE. Addi- tionally, the last decade of war has certainly reinforced the importance of interoperability with our allies, who we cannot afford to meet for the first time in combat. As a result, we must continue to foster relationships and train with the airborne forces of our multi- national partners, who are typically the rapid</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">response forces of their respective nations, in full recognition of the likelihood of operat- ing side-by-side should our countries choose to act in concert against future threats. Thus, as one peers into the future, it is clear that the United States must maintain a diverse GRF that is rapidly deployable to the source of a crisis, highly trained and ready, able to assure access in any environment, and fully interop- erable with potential partners and allies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Prevailing in defense</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Since its inception, the employment or threat of employment of airborne units as the spearhead of an operation has repeat- edly proved its strategic value by demon- strating compelling political resolve. This reinforces the old military adage that in order to deter an adversary, a nation must have the ability to defeat that adversary, and airborne forces are one of the most effective tools for doing so. Airborne JFE operations achieve tactical or operational surprise by making any spot in the world accessible and forcing an adversary to defend in all direc- tions. During the last four decades, airborne JFE has proved itself as a credible option to demonstrate U.S. resolve by introducing sig- nificant combat power into both contested and uncontested operational environments. It remains the fastest way to introduce</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">large numbers of ground forces—4,500 paratroopers in 30 minutes. As part of the GRF, the U.S. joint force has maintained the ability to deploy a brigade-size airborne</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">force anywhere in the world within 96 hours of notification and, if needed, conduct forc- ible entry parachute assault to secure key objectives and execute follow-on combat operations ranging from deterring or defeating adversaries, protecting American and allied citizens and interests, securing key infrastructure, maintaining peace, or conducting stability operations or humani- tarian assistance.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The 1983 intervention in Grenada during Operation <i>Urgent Fury </i>and the 1989 invasion of Panama in Operation <i>Just Cause </i>are notable airborne JFE operations that resulted in the restoration of legitimate gov- ernments.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61"> </span>When diplomatic efforts failed to achieve policy objectives, our joint force quickly achieved air superiority and rapidly projected land power for the decisive effect of removing hostile regimes. The success</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of these operations undoubtedly deterred future aggressors across the globe.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Airborne JFE is such a powerful instru- ment of national power that the threat of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">its employment can be as compelling as the reality. The multinational military interven- tion in Haiti clearly demonstrated this strate- gic deterrent value. In September 1994, Presi- dent Bill Clinton approved Operation <i>Uphold Democracy </i>to forcibly remove the military regime installed by the 1991 coup d’état</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">that overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the elected president.

However, they are not limited to parachute assaults and lethal operations. They are agile forces prepared to meet myriad potential crises thanks to a training regimen for the full spectrum of operations against hybrid enemy threats.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following three operations</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">clearly demonstrate the broad utility of 82<span class="s60">nd</span><span class="s61"> </span>Airborne Division and its rapid response capability. In 1988, when the Sandinista government of Nicaragua threatened the borders of Honduras, President Ronald Reagan launched Operation <i>Golden Pheas- ant </i>to counter Nicaraguan military incur- sions into the border areas of Honduras. Airborne JFE forces departed home on a short-notice deployment exercise consisting of an airborne assault and air-land opera- tions followed by combined patrols along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border. The deployment was publicly described as a joint maneuver exercise, but the show of force, covered by international media, caused the Sandinistas to rapidly withdraw across their border, effectively deescalating the situation.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Six days after his invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein massed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">his armored forces on the Saudi Arabian border, threatening the Kingdom’s sover- eignty. President George H.W. Bush ordered air and ground forces to deploy to Saudi Arabia in response to a request from King Fahd. Within 48 hours of notification, lead elements of the Division Readiness Brigade (DRB) were on their way to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, becoming the initial American pres- ence on the ground and drawing “the line</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the sand.”<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61"> </span>The 82<span class="s60">n</span><span class="s61">d </span>Airborne Division</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">understanding, fell in on mature infrastruc- tures, and enjoyed unchallenged access to the theaters.

In the initial stages, we will not possess all of the situational understanding that we desire and will have to fight for access to the theater against opponents’ antiaccess capa- bilities.

In order to respond to global con- tingencies, the GRF—as a microcosm of what DOD offers as a whole—provides a menu</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of rapidly deployable forces to give national leaders and combatant commanders options for dealing with unforeseen challenges. As contributors to the GRF, the Services must organize, train, equip, and maintain their GRF contributions to ensure strategic flex- ibility, strategic depth, and strategic reach.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Strategic Flexibility. <span class="p">The GRF pro- vides our leadership with strategic flexibility by delivering tailorable and scalable forma- tions via multiple methods, which requires our adversaries to defend in all directions. In order to deliver these formations over great distances, the Army is dependent on the capabilities and future modernization plans of the Air Force and Navy. To achieve cross- domain effectiveness against A2/AD strate- gies arrayed in depth and time, each Service must collaborate on multidomain require- ments using airborne, amphibious, and air assault JFE elements.

The concept defines general principles that describe how the joint force would approach opposed access and requisite capabilities for a cross-domain and in-depth execution.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">0 </span>These factors should largely determine the size, structure, and resources necessary to shape the core joint force capabilities and capacities required by</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">lished, airborne forces allow the joint force to maintain the momentum by rapidly seizing key terrain and infrastructure to enable further penetration or follow-on operations. Once a foothold is seized and a lodgment established, follow-on forces would arrive; the joint force would then transition from reacting to A2/AD threats to dislocating and defeating the enemy at their origin. In recog- nition that a one-size-fits-all capability will likely fall short of unanticipated demands, the GRF must provide a mission-tailored force, in both size and capability, that is pre- pared to gain access and operate and sustain itself against the range of threats across a distributed battlefield under the harshest conditions.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">2 </span>To meet those requirements, airborne JFE forces are ready to provide more than 4,500 paratroopers and mission-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">essential equipment, arrive anywhere in the world within 96-hours plus flight time and parachute into multiple drop zones</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in a matter of minutes.

These partners, however, still possess complementary capabilities and niche competencies that can advance com- bined efforts to achieve common goals. The French intervention to aid the Malian army against al Qaeda affiliates near Timbuktu, Mali, in January and February 2013, is an example. During Operation <i>Serval</i>, the French 11<span class="s60">t</span><span class="s61">h </span>parachute brigade and special operations forces conducted three opposed airborne operations to decisively defeat the threat where it was based.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">4 </span>Though uniquely enabled by the presence of French support structures in neighboring countries, the French military lacked the strategic airlift</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to gain and maintain access. Ten countries provided strategic airlift, refueling, and  other specialized capabilities to cover the shortfalls. French air force officials remarked that “international partners, including the United States for the first time, were com- fortable working under French operational command because of years of joint training and increased command and control (C2)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">interoperability.”<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">5 </span>Operation <i>Serval </i>dem- onstrated how our partners embrace a new paradigm—where collaboration and the combination of limited capabilities create the ability to mass joint forces to decisively defeat aggression in remote areas of the world that would otherwise remain inaccessible.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">We have entered an era when mission requirements no longer allow individual Services and, in some cases, individual nations to act alone. To this end, the 82<span class="s60">nd</span><span class="s61"> </span>cooperates with airborne forces from 15 nations in a multinational airborne com- munity of purpose to ensure interoperability and rapid response capability development. An underlying outcome of airborne JFE is that it serves as the mechanism to facilitate the introduction and employment of other DOD and partner capabilities, purposefully conveying tactical action into operational effect. Hence, strategic depth requires per- vasive interoperability within the joint force and between the United States and its allies. If this is not addressed, we may find our vital national interests under attack and just beyond our reach.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Strategic Reach. <span class="p">Providing a responsive airborne JFE capability that projects land power anywhere on the globe is possible only through inter-Service collaboration that defines mission requirements and requisite capabilities and then allocates sufficient resources and training. The joint force has become increasingly interdependent, but Service-centric budget planning, program- ming, and execution complicate the ability</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to develop and maintain critical multido- main capabilities. Currently, Services and partner nations struggle to balance mission demands, personnel management, and modernization requirements, while trying to reduce expenditures. Under such conditions, prioritizing resources against unanticipated future challenges becomes problematic.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">To provide the joint force with flexible options, 82<span class="s60">n</span><span class="s61">d </span>Airborne Division, the Army’s largest contributor to the GRF, concentrates its focus on “winning the next war” by building competencies at every echelon in the following areas:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">GRF-directed mission training with a specific emphasis on deploying an airborne Infantry Battalion task force within 18 hours of notification to conduct airborne JFE and an airborne Brigade Combat Team within 96 hours of notification</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">strategic deployment process and ensuring the ability to rapidly out-load person- nel and equipment under short notice with joint  partners</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><span class="s81">■■ </span>mission command capability to conduct  joint,  interagency,  intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM) crisis-action plan- ning prior to deployment, continue planning and situational awareness during the deploy- ment and while en route, and employ small footprint command nodes that use reach-back to 82<span class="s60">n</span><span class="s61">d   </span>Airborne Division’s main command post and joint operations center at Fort Bragg</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">■■ <span class="p">aligned training exercises and objec- tives with emerging combatant commander requirements and JIIM partners.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">However, 82<span class="s60">n</span><span class="s61">d </span>Airborne Division must balance these efforts with the requirement to continue to provide forces to Afghanistan and remain postured to reinforce units already forward.

Not only does it supply the strategic lift to deploy airborne forces and enablers, but, depending on prox- imity to the littorals, it may have the sole responsibility for defeating enemy A2/AD through offensive and defensive counter-air and suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses. A global response capability thus requires setting priorities and posture decisions that ensure effective global en- route infrastructure and the maintenance</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of strategic lift assets.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">6 </span>Current fiscal goals force senior leaders in the Services to make tough choices that meet real-world mission demands first and then mitigate the effects on fleet maintenance, modernization, and training to meet future challenges. In a January memo, the Secretary and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force explained the ratio- nale behind prioritization and curtailment of flying hours and operational and inter- national training exercises. An 18 percent reduction in flying hours has led to a flying stand-down from spring to fall of fiscal year (FY) 2013, driving nearly all flying units not deploying to “unacceptable readiness levels,” sacrificing preparedness for contingencies. To mitigate risk to the current mission, cuts were disproportionately applied across the force.<span class="s60">27</span><span class="s61"> </span>For Air Force Mobility Command, those reductions equated to a 40 percent</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">drop in flying hours and, by the end of FY13, will result in dramatically lower readiness levels that will require extensive time and funding to recover from.<span class="s60">28</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Under these conditions, Army and Air Force individual and crew competencies and the ability to collectively train to airborne JFE are secondary objectives. As one senior Air Force leader stated, “It is easier to go</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to war with the 82<span class="s60">n</span><span class="s61">d </span>than it is to train with you.” Army and Air Force leaders have embraced creativity and collaboration in order to optimize joint integration in every JFE training opportunity. For instance, the JFE Vulnerability exercise conducted by the Air Force Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, combines Army and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Air Force planners and GRF command posts from the division to the battalion levels to rehearse the joint planning and command and control required to defeat A2/AD strate- gies and create a lodgment. The Army’s most recent Joint Operational Access exercise integrated the predeployment certification  of the 317<span class="s60">t</span><span class="s61">h </span>Airlift Group with airborne JFE by the 82<span class="s60">n</span><span class="s61">d </span>Headquarters and a reinforced airborne Brigade Combat Team to seize two airfields simultaneously, evacuate U.S. and allied citizens, and secure chemical weapons and critical infrastructure. Collaboration</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of this scale occurs only through willing teamwork and cooperation among joint commanders who have the mandate to train and maintain an airborne JFE capability for the Nation’s future contingencies.

Slobodan Milosevic, as leader</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of Serbia, was not only a prime instigator of the conflict but also a signatory of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords that ended the war in Bosnia. As the crisis in Kosovo began, Milo- sevic presided over Serbia and Montenegro, which were all that remained of the former Yugoslav federation.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Milosevic had launched his political career in Kosovo, a province of Serbia that overflowed with symbolism and history for the Serb people. His repression of Kosovo’s Albanian majority had initially been met with nonviolent resistance. An armed Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) eventually materialized, threatening Serb rule over Kosovo and the small Serbian minority living there. In 1998, Milosevic dispatched additional security forces into Kosovo to suppress the KLA. His interests, which were certainly vital to him if not to the Serb state, were to retain control of Kosovo, protect his autocratic grip on power rooted there, and maintain the international legitimacy he attained at Dayton.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO countries watched develop- ments in Kosovo with a sense of foreboding. Milosevic was known as the “Butcher of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the Balkans,” and the heavy-handed tactics of his security forces in Kosovo gave rise</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to fears of another round of violence and ethnic cleansing. The United States and its NATO Allies, which had helped end the war in Bosnia after much hesitation, were com- mitted to preventing a new conflict. If diplo- macy failed, they were prepared to consider the early use of military force and shared an uncomfortable suspicion that only the threat of force or its use would move Milosevic. The countries of southeast Europe, aspir-  ing to join NATO and the European Union (EU), were ready to cooperate closely with the Alliance. Russia, however, was wary of further NATO military operations and ready to veto a formal mandate from the United Nations (UN) Security Council.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">President Bill Clinton was under increasing political pressure in the United States. While humanitarian groups and foreign policy experts fretted over a renewed prospect of war and ethnic cleansing,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">many in Congress and the Pentagon were pushing for an “exit” in Bosnia and reluc- tant to commit more forces in the Balkans. Indeed, in March 1998, the administration needed to work closely with Congress to defeat a proposed House of Representa- tives resolution that would have directed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the President to withdraw U.S. forces from Bosnia. To complicate matters further, the President was embroiled in a sex scandal and facing impeachment by the House and a subsequent trial by the Senate. In short, Clinton was not well positioned politically to commit military force to protect a part of the Balkans unknown to most Americans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nAto Interests</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As winter approached in 1998, Kosovo Albanians, displaced from their homes, faced the twin threats of starvation and freezing. Backed by the threat of NATO</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">air strikes, U.S. and European diplomats convinced Milosevic to withdraw Serb security forces and allow the introduction of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitors. Diplomatic efforts, however, were unable to prevent a renewal of fighting when the snow began</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to melt in early 1999. A final push for a dip- lomatic settlement, conducted at a chateau in Rambouillet, France, ended in failure, though it did help unite the Kosovo Alba- nians and establish the broad outlines of an eventual settlement.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In contemplating air strikes in early 1999, the United States and its Allies were conscious of three basic interests at stake. The first interest was humanitarian, to prevent another round of violence and ethnic cleansing. The second was to protect regional stability, minimizing the risk of a new Balkan war. The third was to protect the credibility of NATO, which had suffered during previous Balkan wars but rebounded with the Alliance’s role in implementing the Dayton Accords. An alliance is arguably a “means” not an “end,” and protecting cred- ibility can be a slippery slope. That said, NATO was indeed an important part of Europe’s future security architecture and a means of achieving U.S. regional objectives.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The threats to these interests were real. A massacre of Albanian men, women, and children in the Kosovo village of Račak was a vivid reminder of Milosevic’s campaign</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of violence and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. Ethnic conflict in Kosovo had the potential to rekindle ethnic tensions elsewhere in the region, sparking another round of violence and a breakdown of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia, where NATO had deployed a large peacekeeping force. There was also the threat, which the Alliance took seriously, of ruptured relations with Russia. Offsetting</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">these threats was an important opportunity to build on NATO’s growing cooperation with the United Nations and OSCE to bring an end to the Balkan wars and help realize the vision of a Europe that was whole, free, and at peace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ends, Ways, and means</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO launched Operation <i>Allied  Force </i>in March 1999. As often happens in military operations, the ends, ways, and means evolved during the course of the cam- paign. Initially, NATO’s ends were articu- lated as the “three Ds”: demonstrate NATO resolve, damage the Serb military’s ability</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to harm the people of Kosovo, and deter an even bloodier offensive.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61"> </span>The ways to achieve these ends were simple: limited air</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">strikes on Serb forces in Kosovo and a readi- ness to negotiate a political accord. In the words of one senior administration official, the strategy had shifted “from diplomacy backed by air strikes to air strikes backed by diplomacy.” Means were limited to tactical air strikes and diplomacy designed to keep NATO together as the United States and its Allies awaited a clear signal by Milosevic</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of his readiness to withdraw Serb security forces and negotiate a settlement.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This strategy was based on the flawed assumption that limited air strikes would compel Milosevic to back down quickly. Thus, initial political and military planning assumed an air campaign of days or a few weeks when, in fact, <i>Allied Force </i>lasted over 2 months—78 days. This mistaken assump- tion meant that NATO had neither planned the targets nor deployed the necessary forces for a sustained air campaign. It also meant that Alliance unity was put to a longer test than initially foreseen. Perhaps the only benefit of the extended campaign was that it afforded additional time provided to “plan for success” including the establishment of a UN administration and a NATO-led peace- keeping force.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">There were a number of reasons for this flawed assumption:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">First, senior U.S. diplomatic and mili- tary officials assessed that Milosevic would back down quickly, based in part on their per- sonal experience in dealing with him. After all, the threat of air strikes had caused Milosevic  to withdraw security forces from Kosovo the previous  fall.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><span class="s81">■■ </span>Second, policymakers may have drawn the wrong lessons from NATO’s Operation <i>Deliberate Force </i>in 1995, in which 3 weeks of limited air strikes helped bring Milosevic to the negotiating table at Dayton. There were, however, important differences: NATO’s 1995 air strikes coincided with a Bosnian-Croatian ground offensive. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, Kosovo was a more vital interest to Milosevic than the Serbian parts of Bosnia  were.</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Third, while perhaps only subcon- sciously, a short war assumption may have eased the political decision to intervene. Intervention was already a tough decision for the allies in the face of opposition by</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Russia and the resulting absence of an explicit mandate from the UN Security Council. If allied leaders had also confronted the pos- sibility of an operation lasting 78 days, they may have decided against air strikes and restricted their approach to diplomatic pres- sure and economic sanctions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After several weeks of air strikes,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. and allied leaders realized the need to recalibrate their strategy. Milosevic was not only failing to back down, but his security forces had launched the ethnic cleansing that NATO sought to prevent, burdening neighboring countries with a growing influx of Albanian refugees. It was increasingly apparent that Milosevic thought he could outlast the Alliance. It was also increas- ingly obvious that there were two centers of gravity: the unity of NATO, which Milosevic hoped to defeat, and the will of Milosevic, which was more resilient than expected.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO’s April 1999 summit in Wash- ington, DC, was to have commemorated the Alliance’s 50<span class="s60">t</span><span class="s61">h </span>anniversary. Instead it</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">became the venue for NATO to demonstrate its determination to prevail and to recali- brate its ends, ways, and means.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The Summit Declaration required Milosevic to:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">■■ <span class="p">ensure a verifiable stop to all military action and the immediate ending of violence and repression in Kosovo</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">withdraw his military, police, and para- military  forces</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">agree to the stationing of an interna- tional  military  presence</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">agree to the unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and unhindered access to them by humanitar- ian aid organizations</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">provide credible assurance of his willingness to work for the establishment of a political framework based on the Rambouillet Accords.</span><span class="s60">4</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">These five requirements were effec- tively NATO’s new ends, replacing the  “three Ds” of a month prior. These new ends adapted to the growing exodus of Kosovo Albanians and added the prospect of deploy- ing a NATO-led force in Kosovo once Serb security forces withdrew.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO also expanded ways of bringing pressure on Milosevic, recognizing that air strikes alone might not suffice. The summit declaration spoke of “additional measures” being undertaken by allied governments. The United States, for its part, developed and implemented an expanded “strategic campaign.” This campaign, in combination with NATO air strikes, aimed to:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">degrade Serbia’s capability to conduct repressive operations in Kosovo</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">undermine Milosevic’s pillars of power, which were identified as his security forces, state-controlled media, and close associates (“cronies”)</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">step up international pressure, isolate Serbia, and delegitimize Milosevic</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">plan and prepare a postconflict civil and military presence</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">sustain NATO solidarity.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This expanded set of “ways” was backed by a full range of diplomatic, information, mili- tary, and economic means.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Diplomatically, the Department of State worked closely with EU foreign</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ministers to bring pressure to bear on Milo- sevic and increase his isolation, using his indictment by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague to undercut his legitimacy. The Secretary of State and her senior advisors were on the phone daily with their European counterparts to coordinate statements and diplomatic activity. The Deputy Secretary of State led negotiations involving the Russian prime minister and the EU president to back Milosevic into NATO’s conditions while disabusing him of any impression that Moscow would come to his aid. These negotiations set the basis for the conflict’s end game and shaped the UN Security Council resolution being developed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in New York to terminate the conflict on NATO’s conditions and establish the basis for postconflict stabilization.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">On the information side, public diplomacy backed diplomacy by highlight- ing NATO resolve and unity as well as</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the atrocities being committed by forces under Milosevic’s command. Information operations directed at the Serb people, Serb security forces, and Milosevic cronies sought to undercut support for Milosevic’s actions and encourage defections.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61"> </span>These messages were delivered by multiple media including a “ring around Serbia” of radio transmitters in neighboring countries. Transmitting broad- casts from Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation, the ring was designed to break Milosevic’s monopoly of the airwaves. In addition to delivering muni- tions, NATO F-16 fighters and B-52 bombers dropped leaflets targeted at Serb forces</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and the population more broadly. Those dropped to Serb forces warned of the lethal- ity of NATO forces and sought to encourage defections by reporting on draftee soldiers leaving the fighting in Kosovo to protect protesters in their villages against military police.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Militarily, tactical air strikes were aug- mented by strategic air strikes into Serbia. These included raids against high-visibility targets such as the Ministries of Defense and Interior, government television, bridges, and electrical infrastructure. The strikes, particularly against targets associated with Milosevic’s cronies, were carefully coordi- nated with information operations aimed at undercutting Milosevic’s sources of power. Steps were taken to reduce the risk of civil- ian casualties in populated areas, though media images of a European capital being bombed shook European public support. Less visibly, NATO ships began monitor- ing a U.S. and EU oil embargo on Serbia, and the Alliance stepped up planning and preparations for the introduction of NATO- led ground forces after the air strikes. Some NATO forces were prepositioned in theater to allow for early introduction of a peace- keeping force.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Economically, NATO Allies surged humanitarian relief and economic assistance to the neighboring countries struggling with a growing number of Albanian refugees. NATO deployed a task force to Albania to help with relief efforts, and its peacekeep- ing force prepositioned in Macedonia also</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">helped to construct refugee camps. The United States and European Union targeted sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, on key Milosevic supporters. Targeted individuals, who were used to a luxurious lifestyle, were suddenly unable to travel outside Serbia and grew concerned about accessing their bank accounts in London</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">or Paris. Economic sanctions typically take a long time to have an impact. In the case of Kosovo, their main effect was probably psychological, increasing pressure on Milo- sevic’s cronies and encouraging them to disassociate themselves with his regime.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fog and Friction</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO’s realignment of its ends, ways, and means was essential to its ultimate success when the war grimly ground on longer than anticipated. That said, its longer duration gave added opportunity for fog and friction to play their inevitable role, com- plicating operations and adding unforeseen developments.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">One unwanted surprise was NATO’s inadvertent bombing of the Chinese  embassy in Belgrade. This precise raid against precisely the wrong target disrupted diplomatic efforts to negotiate a UN Security Council resolution to terminate the conflict on NATO’s terms. In doing so, it undoubt- edly renewed the hope of Milosevic and his supporters to outlast the Alliance. Together, these two effects probably added 1 or 2 weeks to the armed conflict. The strike also tested the unity of the Alliance, as did other strikes that accidentally killed both Serb</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">and Albanian civilians. NATO ambassadors implored the military commanders to avoid collateral damage—as though wars could be conducted without human cost.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Alliance decisionmaking was a source of friction. Key targeting decisions were subject to consensus decisions by all Allies. The President needed to make multiple phone calls to other leaders before NATO agreed to augment the air strikes with more strategic targets. Two Allies pushed for “pauses” despite no sign of willingness by Milosevic to meet NATO’s stated condi- tions. Coalition politics and indecision circumscribed the allied ability to escalate air strikes and deliver the “shock and awe” that might have decisively shaken the will of Milosevic and his supporters. NATO unity was indispensable to success, but the price of unity was time and agility.</p><p class="s56" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">War  termination</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Despite fog and friction, the mounting pressures on Milosevic had a cumulative effect:</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Milosevic was increasingly isolated with no obvious way out. NATO’s unity was holding, its conditions were not changing,  and its air strikes were increasing in scope and severity. The EU and UN Secretary-General had aligned themselves with NATO. Coun- tries in the region were supporting NATO politically and militarily. Russia was delivering NATO’s message and not offering an alterna- tive course.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Milosevic’s own political survival was increasingly at risk. He had lost international and domestic legitimacy including through  his international indictment for war crimes. His wife, Mira, was worried about the safety of their family. His advisors were divided and his cronies were fleeing the country.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Milosevic’s control of Kosovo was increasingly at risk. Serb military and police forces were under growing pressure from NATO as the weather improved and U.S.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A-10 ground attack aircraft arrived. There was mounting concern in Serbia about a NATO ground invasion, prompted in part by the prepositioning of NATO peacekeeping forces in the region. The Kosovo Liberation Army had launched offensive operations under the cover of NATO air strikes.</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Milosevic was also offered some  ways to help justify his acceptance of NATO conditions domestically. One important “face saver” was Moscow’s involvement in the final diplomacy and prospect of Russian forces in a follow-on peacekeeping force. Other face- savers included public emphasis on the post-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">conflict role of the UN rather than NATO and recognition that Kosovo, while substantially autonomous, would remain within the terri- tory of the Yugoslav federation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Milosevic conceded to NATO’s condi- tions after 78 days. It can be a matter of debate whether NATO needed that long to bring the right elements of power to bear or whether Milosevic needed 78 days before he was prepared to meet NATO’s conditions. Ultimately, the war ended because the will of NATO overcame the will of Milosevic. NATO did not defeat Serb forces militarily; rather, the Alliance and its members applied a wide range of power that eventually com- pelled Milosevic to meet its demands.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Exactly why Milosevic conceded is unlikely ever to be known. He did not</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">explain his decision and, having died while on trial in The Hague, never will. While different theories exist,<span class="s60">6</span><span class="s61"> </span>it seems reasonable to conclude that the cumulative effect of dip- lomatic isolation, military strikes, informa- tion operations, and targeted sanctions left Milosevic increasingly uncertain of his grip on power and on Kosovo. He probably con- cluded that meeting NATO requirements, with the face savers provided, better served his own vital interests than continuing to try to outlast a still-unified Alliance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A War of Limited Ends Using Limited means</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Air strikes disrupted but did not defeat Serb ground forces operating in Kosovo. Some have thus criticized NATO’s decision, announced at the outset of the operation, to exclude the use of ground forces in combat operations. At a minimum, some critics argue, the prospect of ground attack would have forced Serb forces to mass and become more vulnerable to air interdiction. The buildup of ground forces might also have kept Milosevic from thinking that he could merely hunker down and outlast NATO air strikes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">However, allied leaders had valid reasons for their decision. In the United States, the Clinton administration was con- cerned about securing domestic support for another military intervention in the Balkans when Congress was already pressing to remove ground forces from Bosnia. Indeed, shortly after Operation <i>Allied Force </i>began, the U.S. House of Representatives adopted a resolution prohibiting funds for the deploy- ment of ground forces. The administration was similarly concerned about securing support from allies whose own parliaments would be reluctant to commit ground forces to combat. The administration recognized that airpower gave NATO forces an asym- metric advantage while substantially reduc- ing the risk of casualties. While important interests were at stake, none were so vital, in the judgment of senior policymakers, as to recklessly endanger American lives.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO’s ends, like its means, were also limited. Operation <i>Allied Force </i>sought to compel Milosevic to withdraw Serb forces from Kosovo and permit the return of refugees and the establishment of an international presence. The operation was</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="697" height="297" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Air Force (Blake R.

It is also unlikely that Milosevic would have conceded to his own political demise or that Russia would have cooperated to the limited extent it did.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, NATO Allies increas- ingly recognized that peace in the Balkans would require democracy in Serbia, which was code for the ouster of Milosevic. An unstated goal of NATO’s intervention was to leave Milosevic weaker politically rather than stronger. Undermining Milosevic’s</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">legitimacy and his pillars of support encour- aged his capitulation and also hastened the day he would depart.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Sixteen months after the air strikes ended, Milosevic was out of power, ousted by the Serb people with international support.<span class="s60">7</span><span class="s61"> </span>Military means helped set the con- dition for regime change. However, regime change was neither the established end nor the direct consequence of <i>Allied Force</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Relevance to Future operations</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In January 2012, President Barack Obama and then–Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta issued a new defense strategy that looks beyond the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.<span class="s60">8</span><span class="s61"> </span>The strategy calls for armed forces capable of conducting a broad range of mis- sions, in a full range of contingencies, and in a global context that is increasingly complex,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">all with more limited resources. Opportuni- ties for savings come from reducing the ability to fight two regional conflicts at the same time and from not sizing the force to conduct large-scale stability operations for prolonged periods.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In implementing this strategy, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has promulgated a concept for joint operations that calls for “globally integrated operations” able to “seize, retain, and exploit the initiative in time and across domains.”<span class="s60">9</span><span class="s61"> </span>Part of this concept is a more pronounced role for “small-footprint” capa- bilities such as cyberspace, space, special operations, global strike, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. These represent unique sources of U.S. military advantage that do not entail large or long- term ground force commitments.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This strategy and concept suggest a return to limited military operations such as <i>Allied Force</i>, particularly when our vital</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">interests are not directly threatened. NATO’s Operation <i>Unified Protector </i>in Libya pro- vides a recent example in which the admin- istration limited the scale and duration of the U.S. contribution and excluded the use  of ground forces entirely. As we consider such operations, NATO’s intervention in Kosovo offers the following lessons.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><i><b>Understand the Enemy. </b></i>In limited wars such as <i>Allied Force</i>, the center of gravity is likely to be the will of the adver- sary rather than the adversary’s forces. Success thus results from redirecting the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">enemy’s decisions rather than routing its military. Said differently, forceful coercion takes the place of brute force. Forceful coercion requires in-depth understanding of the enemy leadership and its worldview and interests. It also requires a sound understanding of how the enemy makes and carries out its decisions and which individuals and factors play in that process.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In <i>Allied Force</i>, mapping influence networks within the leadership was just as important as mapping supply routes for the military. A mistaken assumption, such as how quickly an adversary leader would back down, could have a significant impact.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Recognize the Limits of Coercion. <span class="p">Even with a solid understanding of the enemy, forceful coercion has limits. While the United States and its allies had important interests at stake in the Kosovo conflict,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">they were not as vital as Milosevic’s interests in political survival and control of Kosovo. Such an asymmetry of interests may work against the United States when it is prepared only to use limited means against a resolute adversary. Academic research warns of the risk of failure in coercion when the stakes are asymmetric and an adversary thinks, as Milosevic probably did for a time, that our will is more vulnerable than his.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Moreover, without employing overwhelming force to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">defeat adversary forces, the impact of forceful coercion may be more cumulative than deci- sive. Building up over time, and hence taking more time, the cumulative effect of coercion may provide less certainty of success and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">more opportunity for fog and friction to take their toll. Like <i>Allied Force</i>, most wars, and particularly limited wars, take longer than the generals plan and the politicians hope.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Bring a Broad Range of Power to Bear. <span class="p">With military means limited, success will be even more dependent on employing a broad range of nonmilitary means, from overt diplomacy to covert action. As with Kosovo, air strikes alone are unlikely to suffice.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In many cases, military force may play a supporting role, such as deterring provoca- tions or reassuring allies, while the main attacks on the adversary’s will are conducted through diplomatic, informational, and eco- nomic means. Good strategic sense counsels against ruling out the use of the full range</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of military capabilities including ground forces; however, as with Kosovo (and Libya since), domestic and international condi- tions may make this unavoidable. In such cases, the United States may need to build up a reliable partner on the ground not only to win the war but also to influence the peace. In some cases, allied forces may fill this gap. In others, the United States might be forced to confront the inevitable risks of relying</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on indigenous forces such as the Kosovo Liberation Army that are not well known to us and may not share our ends or our view of acceptable means.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><i><b>Limited Ends to Reflect Limited Means. </b></i>Limiting means may be neces- sary to build and sustain domestic and international support, as was the case with <i>Allied Force</i>. This will often require limit- ing the ends. Thus, in the case of Kosovo,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO’s ends were limited to protecting the population in Kosovo and did not extend  to making Kosovo independent or ousting</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Milosevic from Belgrade. Either would have substantially complicated support for the operation and the associated diplomacy, and the second would have likely required</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a major ground component. In coercive operations using limited means, changing  a regime’s behavior may be more feasible than changing the regime. Even then, the behavior changes sought may need to be limited in the absence of a sustained pres- ence on the ground or in the vicinity to ensure compliance. Political leaders will need to exercise discipline to ensure that the political dynamics of building domestic</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and international support do not cause ends to outpace the means. Political leaders may not want, for example, to draw “red lines”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">or declare behavior “intolerable” if they and their nations are not ready to commit the means necessary to enforce the red lines or stop the behavior. Ends must reflect means, and strategy should drive declaratory policy, not the reverse.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><i><b>Be Ready for Adversity and Surprise. </b></i>Kosovo was complex politically and militar- ily. Future wars of limited ends and means may be even more complex. Many potential adversaries are developing capabilities to undercut the asymmetric advantages demon- strated by the United States and its allies in Operation <i>Allied Force</i>. Imagine conducting the same air operations in an antiaccess/area- denial environment against an enemy with more sophisticated air defenses and capable of jamming our satellite communications and navigation. Imagine operating against an adversary who can respond asymmetrically with cyber or terror attacks on our home- land. Future wars may also not benefit from the coalition unity demonstrated by NATO or the political and logistical support from neighboring countries. Sanctuaries, weak and ambivalent governments, and transna- tional forces may create a more challenging regional context. Finally, like all wars, future conflict will suffer from fog and friction and the element of surprise. Small footprints do not necessarily translate to small risks. It  may not take many accidents like the strike on the Chinese embassy to break a fragile coalition or domestic consensus.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Operation <i>Allied Force </i>lasted longer than planned and for a time helped precipi- tate the ethnic cleansing it sought to prevent. Yet NATO achieved its objectives at reason- able cost and, in retrospect, in reasonable time. Allied cohesion held and Milosevic’s will broke.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As the United States looks beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, <i>Allied Force </i>offers caution- ary lessons about the efficacy of future oper- ations for limited ends using limited means. Modesty of means requires modesty in ends. Imperatives to success include understand- ing the enemy, recognizing the limits of coercion, employing a wide range of national power, and being ready for adversity and surprise. Even then, policymakers need to think long and hard about the employment of military power and not be “beguiled”<span class="s87">11</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">by hopes of quick success free of cost and adverse consequence. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">n o t E S</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="220" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_021.png"/></span></p><ol id="l6"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">For thoughtful analysis of Operation <i>Allied Force </i>and associated lessons learned, see Wesley</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">K.

The world collectively</p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">consummated the resolve of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the international community to protect the global citizenry from atrocities, even those originating in their own state. <i>Odyssey Dawn </i>also presented significant challenges since</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it was the first operation of its kind and was</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">political and military implications that are important for both statesmen and military leaders to understand. To fully grasp the sig- nificance of <i>Odyssey Dawn</i>, it is important to understand the recent history that led to the events of the March 2011 air campaign.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="459" height="1" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_023.png"/></span></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;">Major General Margaret h.

The events truly affronted the international com- munity and eventually led to a revolution of political ideas.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Tribal violence in Rwanda between the Hutus and Tutsis in 1994 turned into a bloody civil war that removed the minority Tutsis from power and placed the previ- ously disenfranchised Hutus in control of the country. The Hutus had chafed under the brutal rule of the Tutsis for decades, so once the Hutus seized power, they started  a campaign to systematically destroy Tutsi resistance and punish them for their previ-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ous actions. This led to the rampant murder of Tutsis and eventually spiraled into widespread genocide. Although the United Nations initially sent peacekeeping troops to Rwanda, the conflict was quickly reclassified as a civil war and the UN had to extricate itself from the situation in accordance with its charter.<span class="s60">1</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This left soon-to-be Secretary-General Kofi Annan sorely disappointed by the inability of the global community to aid those who were not protected by their own governments. The situation was desperate as women and children were raped and mur- dered and the global community was forced to watch, unable to intervene through the United Nations. By the end of the conflict, over 800,000 people had been executed at the hands of their own government in the short period of 100 days.<span class="s60">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Even while violence was erupting in Rwanda, the Balkan region was thrown into violent turmoil. Fractious new nations that separated from Yugoslavia found themselves faced with national identity crises following the disintegration of the former communist nation. While the communist dictator Josip Tito had managed to suppress much of the ethnic and religious hatred in the region, his death and the collapse of the Yugoslavian nation revived old hatreds and religious strife. The most conflicted of these fledgling nations was the small country of Bosnia- Herzegovina. The rift among the predomi- nantly Orthodox Serbian people, Catholic Croatians, and Muslim Albanians led to genocide by the Serbs against the Albanians during the late 1990s. The murder of over 100,000 ethnic Albanian Muslims eventually forced the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza- tion (NATO) to intervene in 1999, while UN peacekeepers stationed in the country had</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to remain neutral as they stood by witness-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ing the atrocities.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61"> </span>Unlike Rwanda, where  no one intervened and the world sat idly by, despite impassioned pleas for intervention, NATO intervention in Bosnia was met with as much controversy as was the lack of inter- vention in Rwanda. Russia and China both argued that NATO illegally circumvented the UN Security Council (UNSC) by acting without its backing,<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61"> </span>but the action was later justified by UNSC Resolution (UNSCR) 1244.<span class="s60">5</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In the Millennium Report of the UN Secretary-General titled <i>We the Peoples</i>, Kofi Annan specifically addressed both the trag- edies of Rwanda and Bosnia and, for the first time, suggested that the world body should intervene in the case of atrocities within the borders of sovereign nations under certain circumstances.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Humanitarian intervention is a sensi- tive issue fraught with political difficulty and not susceptible to easy answers. But surely no legal principle—not even sov- ereignty—can ever shield crimes against humanity. Where such crimes occur and peaceful attempts to halt them have been exhausted, the UNSC has a moral duty to act on behalf of the international commu- nity. The fact that we cannot protect people everywhere is no reason for doing nothing when we can. Armed intervention must always remain the option of last resort, but in the face of mass murder it is an option that cannot be relinquished.<span class="s60">6</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The significance of the Secretary- General’s remarks was not lost on the global community. In an effort to address these concerns, the government of Canada set up the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) in 2001. The commission submitted a report titled <i>The Responsibility to Protect </i>to the UN General Assembly and set out to develop a legal construct through which</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">the international community could protect those who were not protected by their own governments.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The concept of the responsibility to protect (R2P), developed by the ICISS report, hinges on the belief that sovereignty grants the privilege to nations to govern indepen- dently, but it also comes with a responsibility to the people who are governed. The respon- sibility is for governments to protect their people from “avoidable catastrophe—from mass murder and rape, from starvation—but that when they are unwilling or unable to do</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">so, that responsibility must be borne by the broader community of states.”<span class="s60">7</span><span class="s61"> </span>The ICISS report was significant not only because it addressed the issue of humanitarian inter- vention and framed it as a legal construct, but also because it attempted to lay out a pre- scriptive method for operational execution. It does so by dividing R2P into three distinct parts: responsibility to prevent, responsibil- ity to react, and responsibility to rebuild. This allows for international support prior  to an atrocity and for normalization after intervention has occurred.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">At the 2005 World Summit, the ICISS work was unanimously ratified by the UN General Assembly in paragraphs 138 and 139 of that assembly’s resolution:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l7"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><p class="s49" style="display: inline;">Each individual State has the respon- sibility to protect its populations from geno- cide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.

While the protests associated with the Arab Spring were not directly associated with R2P, it was the reaction of the Libyan government, led by Muammar Qadhafi, that caught the attention of the international</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">community. Qadhafi on numerous occa- sions ordered security forces and mercenar- ies to open fire on unarmed protesters, leading to the death of hundreds of citizens. He also ordered his aircraft and artillery to fire on civilian populations. These actions led the UNSC to refer Qadhafi to the Inter- national Criminal Court for war crimes on February 26, 2011,<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">1 </span>and led to the first UN decision to intervene in the domestic affairs of a nation, citing the responsibility to protect, on March 18, 2011.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">On March 19, Operation <i>Odyssey Dawn </i>was under way, tasked with protecting the Libyan people from their own government</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in accordance with UNSCR 1973, which allowed for any necessary action to protect the civilian population of Libya and the implementation of a no-fly zone over the country, but did not allow for foreign troops to set foot on Libyan soil.<span class="s60">12</span><span class="s61"> </span>So in addition to being the first test of R2P, <i>Odyssey Dawn </i>was almost purely an air operation with coalition partners participating under a UN mandate.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan taught coalition forces the value of protect-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ing innocent civilians in order to gain public trust when thwarting aggressors attempting to destabilize civilians’ way of life. But pro- tecting a populace is different from ensuring that innocent women and children are safe and provided with relief assistance. For the first time in history, a foreign military force was tasked by the United Nations to protect a society when the internal mechanisms of its nation failed to protect it, and that force was a complex coalition of militaries with different capabilities that was prohibited from occupy- ing ground within the battlespace.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Planning for Operation <i>Odyssey  Dawn </i>began in late February. As the United Nations was adopting UNSCR 1970, which demanded that the Libyan government end</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the violence,<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">3 </span>17<span class="s60">t</span><span class="s61">h </span>Air Force was standing up 24/7 operations and was tasked with plan- ning for a no-fly zone. The time between</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the start of crisis action planning and the first strike was merely 21 days. During those critical 3 weeks, the military situation on the ground and the political environment were chaotic. The international community vacil- lated and Washington insiders were skepti-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">cal that the United States would get involved in yet another conflict in the region. This highly dynamic environment created a great challenge to planners, who were presented with new objectives, approaches, and priori- ties every day.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">When UNSCR 1973 was passed, plan- ners were unaware of the precedent that had been set, but they knew that what the UN had authorized presented a unique military objective and many challenges. The plan was to start by creating a permissive environ- ment for coalition aircraft to operate in. This would maximize military effects, minimize risk to coalition forces, and limit expansion of committed forces due to surface-to air casualties. The first task was to shut down Libyan air operations and air defenses. This represented the first layer of the onion that needed to be peeled back before airpower could discharge the task of protecting the Libyan people. Specifically, the longer range surface-to-air missiles that could threaten the Airborne Warning and Control System, Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System, and tankers needed to be disabled immediately, followed by the rest of the Libyan integrated air defense system (IADS).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Although dismantling a nation’s IADS is never easy, it is a familiar operation for air planners. The challenge to gain air</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">superiority and establish the no-fly zone was next. Aircrews generally strike two types of targets: fixed and mobile. Attacks on fixed targets are typically planned ahead of time and have clear objectives, such as bombing a command bunker or striking a critical node in a power or communications network. Mobile targets are typically identified in a more dynamic environment and in close coordination with fielded forces that have real-time intelligence about the situation</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on the ground. The mandate in UNSCR 1973 that the coalition not field an occupy- ing ground force complicated this type of targeting. The solution was to use U.S. crews trained to fly strike coordination and recon- naissance (SCAR) missions when operating in close proximity to the civilian population. These crews were able to find, fix, and finish targets from the air without confirmation from ground forces.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In traditional warfare, forces have a clear enemy and know who their allies are, but not much was known about the resis- tance in Libya, and the United Nations was not taking sides. All that was known was</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">that the Libyan government had perpetrated crimes against the population, and it was the coalition’s responsibility to make sure no one else on either side did it again. This environment placed a huge burden on the aircrews, who had to make difficult deci-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">sions while striking tactical targets, knowing a mistake would have huge strategic implica- tions. In addition to the difficult task these airmen faced, they were operating within</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">an ad hoc coalition of operational partners, including some who had never worked with each other and many with systems that did not operate well together. The professional- ism, training, and experience of those coali- tion aircrews made this extremely complex operation possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The translation of R2P from diplomatic theory to daily target selection was made more difficult by unique command struc- tures and the coalition environment, which added to the complexities of execution from both a policy and a capability standpoint.  Few of the partners possessed all the capabili- ties needed to perform many of the command and control, targeting, and integration func- tions required in this type of dynamic air operation. Additionally, the tactical systems and training needed to make many of the surgical dynamic strikes were resident with only the most advanced partners.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The importance of a military coalition in such an operation was far more signifi- cant than the capabilities that individual nations brought to the table. It signified the global community’s commitment to stand against the criminal activities of a govern- ment that perpetrated crimes against its own people. In the case of Libya, Washington</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">felt strongly about transitioning to a non- U.S.-led operation, and since the majority  of the partners were also NATO members, the decision seemed clear. On March 31, 2011, a mere 13 days after the first sorties were launched, the U.S. command element transferred operational control to NATO. Operations continued under NATO-led Operation <i>Unified Protector </i>for an addi- tional 7 months, when the rebel leaders had created a National Transitional Council  and officially declared Libya liberated. The events in Libya since have been tumultuous, but it is important to remember that R2P</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is not about nation-building or removal of national leaders. The mandate is simply to protect innocent civilians from violence, which was accomplished in Libya.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">It is important to note that Russia and China, which hold veto authority on the Security Council, abstained from the vote  on UNSCR 1973. However, after the military intervention began, Russian Premier Vladi- mir Putin expressed concern, which was echoed by the Chinese Communist Party,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">that R2P was an excuse for the United States, United Kingdom, and France to forward their political and economic interests in the region and not the altruistic protection of civilians.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">4 </span>Whether Russia and China truly believe this, it will be difficult for them to either vote for or abstain from future UNSC resolutions to enforce R2P without these statements reverberating.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">R2P will continue to be debated as the United Nations struggles with future</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">examples of civilian abuse by those in power. The precedent has been set in Libya, but it</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is important to remember that international order is not governed by precedent as much as realpolitik. The questions that remain  are whether future R2P interventions will be authorized and under what unique circumstances some of the more reticent UNSC member nations would allow for intervention. Examples of civilian casualties emerging from the fighting in Syria could justify intervention in accordance with R2P,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">assuming all of the preceding measures were taken, but the political will of the UNSC is notably absent. This begs the question of whether Operation <i>Odyssey Dawn</i>’s mission to shoulder R2P will be the first of many operations to protect those who cannot defend themselves or merely a historical footnote, relegating enforcement of R2P to the long list of good ideas that failed to take hold. As Kofi Annan stated, “The fact that we cannot protect people everywhere is no reason for doing nothing when we can.”<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">5</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">If R2P is to be implemented again as a justification to act, it will certainly include  a far more restrictive set of limitations, and the approval of Russia and China may prove more difficult to obtain. These nations and other UNSC member states are motivated by national agendas leading to permanent member intransigence, watered-down authorizations, and bureaucratic entrench- ment. Overcoming these agendas will prove crucial to the UNSC approving action by citing R2P in the future. But other obstacles exist outside of the political arena, not the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">least of which is the military might of poten- tial adversaries.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Idealism aside, no one will attempt to enforce R2P when the object state is capable of inflicting significant harm on the force prosecuting the action. That begs the question of how much perceived risk contributing nations would be willing to undertake to defend the citizenship of a foreign nation. As seemingly novel as the air-only approach appeared, it may be the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">means for future R2P enforcement because it is less risky when applied against less sophis- ticated states. While the claim that airpower can unilaterally win major conflicts is a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">little far-fetched, its ability to win more limited objectives while avoiding long-term entanglement is well documented. Histori- cally, airpower has been able to accomplish this at a much smaller human cost than surface forces could. With these consider- ations in mind, for R2P enforcement to be exercised again it would require that none of the UNSC permanent member nations have close ties to the offending nation, the offend- ing nation does not have credible means of inflicting harm on coalition airpower, and the environment is favorable for airpower enforcement.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Libya was a perfect environment for R2P enforcement because its leadership lacked meaningful allies and significant military capability and resided in a desert where it is hard to hide from air strikes. Even if another perfect case arises, we must be careful not to use <i>Odyssey Dawn </i>as a template. That does not mean that valuable lessons cannot be drawn from the conflict.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Given that an air-centric solution to future operations such as <i>Odyssey Dawn </i>is likely, it is important to ensure that U.S.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">airpower providers remain prepared to fight independent of surface forces. The lesson the United States should take away from</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the Libya operation is that it must retain military flexibility. As our forces work to enhance joint integration among sister Ser- vices, we must not come to rely too heavily on other component forces. The ability</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to conduct SCAR missions was critical to making <i>Odyssey Dawn </i>possible and high- lights the need for such organic capabilities. Despite future fiscal constraints, we must retain vital resources that allow for this type of flexibility and enhance them when possible. Additionally, we must purchase and train with a variety of munition types and yields. Variable yield warheads allow for surgical strikes with adequate stopping</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">power while minimizing collateral damage. This will be critical as we prepare to engage in operations spanning the spectrum of conflict, requiring us to find new ways to harness violence in the pursuit of our objec- tives. Finally, we must train our warfighting leaders from the start to make critical deci- sions in a dynamic environment. This can be done by seeking out highly promising young officers and deliberately placing them in command and control billets such as the Combined Air Operations Center and the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Joint Operations Center to foster operational decisionmaking. While the U.S. military creates independent-minded leaders better than anyone in the world, we must redouble our effort. Warfare is constantly evolving. As we find new ways to apply coercive force against our adversaries in new regions, we will continue to see military leaders chal- lenged with unforeseen scenarios. The threat from contested airspace and the challenges governed by political constraints are just</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a few types of the dynamic environments our Airmen will face. The specter of com- munication disruption, which is the new fog of war, necessitates that we focus on training to make distributed operations viable and more than just a catch phrase. It is critical that we inculcate the broad range of knowledge necessary to best equip those leaders and empower them to lead at all</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">operational levels and within complex coali- tion environments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="220" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_025.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The legacy of R2P politically, regard- less of future implications for military inter- vention, is its implications for sovereignty. R2P is arguably the most radical adjustment to sovereignty since the Peace of Westphalia was signed in 1648. Now sovereignty does not simply protect the nation; it also protects the citizens from the nation. This concept is a victory for democracy because it pledges to support sovereign rule only when it protects the populace it governs. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">n o t E S</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l8"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">United Nations (UN) Charter, Chapter II, Article 2, Paragraph 1, states, the “Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.” Paragraph 7 states, “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII.”</p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">“Rwanda: How the genocide happened,” BBC, December 18, 2008, available at &lt;http:// news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1288230.stm&gt;.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">“Bosnian Genocide,” <i>History.com</i><a href="http://www.history.com/topics/" class="a" target="_blank">, n.d., available at &lt;www.history.com/topics</a>/ bosnian-genocide&gt;.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">Russian President Boris Yeltsin was pre- pared to use UN Security Council veto authority to “block action in the Balkans, but never had  the opportunity when [the North Atlantic Treaty Organization] made an unprecedented move of acting unilaterally without a UN resolution.” See Clara Portela, <i>Humanitarian Intervention, NATO and International Law: Can the Institution of Humanitarian Intervention Justify Unauthorised Action? </i>(Berlin: Berlin Information-center for Transatlantic Security, December 2000).</p></li><li style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">See “NATO,” <i>Politics.co.uk</i>, 2012, available at</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/nato" class="a" target="_blank">&lt;www.politics.co.uk/reference/nat</a>o&gt;.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">Kofi A.

On February 26, 2011, the UN Security Council (UNSC) unanimously adopted UNSC Resolution (UNSCR) 1970, which “[e]xpress[ed] grave concern at the situation in the Arab Jama- hiriya,” “condemn[ed] the violence and use of force against civilians,” and “[d]eplored the gross and systematic violation of human rights in Libya.”<span class="s60">8</span><span class="s61"> </span>The resolution called upon</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">agencies and make available humanitarian and related assistance” in Libya.<span class="s60">9</span><span class="s61"> </span>While important, this resolution did not authorize member states to use military force against Qadhafi’s regime.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The passage of UNSC Resolution 1970 had no noticeable effect.

The first resulted from Baghdad’s refusal to cease repression of Kurdish and Shi’ite groups.<span class="s60">50</span><span class="s61"> </span>The second concerned violations of the April 3, 1991, cease-fire accord.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">1 </span>The third related to the Iraqi deployment of missiles in the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">no-fly zone in violation of UNSCR 687 and the threat it posed to coalition aircraft.<span class="s60">52</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In each instance in Iraq, to include  the current conflict, and in the hostilities in Afghanistan, the President has reported to Congress “consistent with” the War Powers Resolution, not “pursuant to” it. This was true in Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Somalia as well. Congress agreed to disagree with this language but has nevertheless provided authorization and funding under section 5(b) of the resolution. What makes U.S.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">military involvement in Libya so different is the President’s failure to seek authorization for a <i>continued </i>military presence beyond the 60-day requirement.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As controversial as War Powers issues have been, President Obama is the first Commander in Chief to determine that bombing and blockading an adversary is not an engagement in “hostilities.” Section 2(a) of the War Powers Resolution states:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">2(a). It is the purpose of the joint resolution to fulfill the intent of the framers of the Consti- tution of the United States and insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of the United States armed forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involve- ment in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and to the continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">When military action reached day 60 on May 19, 2011, President Obama showed no inclination to seek the approval of Congress for the continuation of the Libya</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">mission. While it is true that <i>hostilities </i>are not defined in the War Powers Resolution, the United States had ground forces in Libya, and U.S. forces were enforcing a no-fly zone, conducting bombing raids, firing cruise missiles, directing lethal drone strikes, and maintaining a tight naval blockade. These are all acts of war and constitute involve- ment in hostilities in any nation’s lexicon. Moreover, while Washington has now taken on a supporting role under NATO leader- ship, U.S. military leaders lead NATO, and the War Powers Resolution clearly states</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">that the “introduction of U.S. forces” applies in these circumstances.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">3 </span>U.S. participation in the NATO-led effort has included drone attacks, aerial refueling of allied combat aircraft, electronic jamming, search and rescue missions, and other assistance to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the “kinetic operations” defined by Presi- dent Obama to be outside the definition of “hostilities.”</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">One of the unfortunate realities about being a superpower, and the United States is arguably the only one at present, is that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">it possesses capabilities and resources not available elsewhere. The United States, as Professor Robert Chesney points out, “has close air support and quick response capa- bilities—including, but not limited to, armed drones—that the allies could not replicate, and without which the [Libya] operation might fail.”<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">4 </span>More interesting, though, is the obvious result of the new White House defi- nition of <i>hostilities </i>to embrace intensity, fre- quency, and risk to U.S. personnel. President Obama is likely creating a dangerous prec- edent that could severely limit congressional prerogatives in the War Powers process and frustrate the framers’ intent.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Current legal and policy planning for future operations could also be greatly altered by the new definition of hostili- ties.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">5 </span>If a serving or future President can</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">argue that a lethal but singular strike on the nuclear weapons capability of a potential adversary is justified without congressional notification or approval, neither the War Powers statute nor constitutional parity between branches of government would any longer have relevance.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Of concern as well is the White House view that senior U.S. military commanders assigned to NATO or a similar UN structure are no longer subject to the constraints of section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolution.<span class="s60">56</span><span class="s61"> </span>This could provide a President absolute</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="220" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_032.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">license to support these operations militarily while avoiding the strictures of the resolu- tion. Equally troubling for the Airmen flying bombing missions, Sailors enforcing a naval blockade, or U.S. personnel maintaining a no-fly zone, changing the definition will in no way diminish the risks they are exposed to in executing their missions. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">n o t E S</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l10"><li style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">War Powers Resolution, Pub.

On what</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">intellectual foundation should a state build its cyber attack policy and strategy? If an outsider wanted to understand an actor’s strategic guidance, what clues would he look for?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Answers to these questions could—and this article argues <i>should</i>—reside in four foundational elements: contextual views,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the cyber attack spectrum, balance of focus, and appropriate circumstances. How an actor approaches each of these elements fundamentally shapes the myriad details of subsequent policy and strategy. One could use a framework based on these elements as a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">model to think about and discuss cyber attack in a structured way, a basis for forming one’s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_041.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">own policy and strategy, or a tool for assessing and understanding the strategic guidance of another actor. This article first presents such  a framework and then uses it to make recom- mendations for U.S. national guidance.<span class="s60">2</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Framework</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The proposed cyber attack framework consists of the following four foundational elements:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Context: To what extent does cyber attack provide a new way to do things along two dimensions—type of activities and view of the  strategic  environment?</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Spectrum: How broadly and in what arrangement does one consider the spectrum of cyber attack possibilities?</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Focus: What is the optimal balance of focus along the continuum of cyber attack as an enabling function, an independent capabil- ity, and a strategic attack?</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">■■ <span class="p">Circumstances: What are the appropri- ate circumstances—legal, ethical, and pruden- tial—in which to conduct cyber attacks?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The clarity with which an actor addresses these four elements undergirds well-defined, coherent guidance. Clear conceptions do not guarantee effective policy, but they do facili- tate it. Ambiguous answers will likely result in underdeveloped, inconsistent, or ineffective guidance.<span class="s60">3</span></p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Contextual View. <span class="p">The first and most significant element addresses an actor’s contextual view of cyber attack in terms of the novelty of the types of activities conducted and the strategic environ-  ment in which these occur. In its simplest expression, a cyber attack is a new way to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">conduct an attack; cyber provides a new set of tools to accomplish familiar tasks. This is significant. Israel’s reported cyber attack against air defenses during a 2007 strike on a Syrian nuclear weapons facility provides an example. During the strike, Syrian  radar screens did not show the incoming Israeli aircraft because an Israeli cyber attack had taken control of the systems, enabling the fighters to arrive undetected.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61"> </span>Other methods have been used to negate air defenses (for example, stealth aircraft and radar jamming); however, cyber attack allowed use of nonstealthy aircraft while concealing not only specific aircraft loca- tions, but also that there was an imminent air attack at all. Cyber attack provided clear</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">advantages, but nonetheless it performed a familiar task.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">However, cyber attack also offers revolu- tionary capabilities. The explosion of comput- ing power, the increasing interconnectedness of computer operations, and the integration  of computers and associated networks into so many functions of modern society have led to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the emergence of cyberspace as a domain unto itself.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61"> </span>Within this realm, actors can conduct activities or achieve effects not otherwise attainable.<span class="s60">6</span><span class="s61"> </span>This first contextual dimension captures the extent to which activities or effects represent a new kind in and of them- selves, or to which they are practicable with a notably greater scope, intensity, frequency, or magnitude than what is achievable through other means.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The second dimension of the con- textual view consists of the novelty and dynamic nature of the strategic environ- ment. Four changes have occurred over  the last century that collectively demand fundamentally different ways of thinking. First, the globe contains less unclaimed or internationally contested space. The end of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">imperial expansion, establishment of states covering the globe, development of inter- national law, and creation of institutions</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to help resolve disputes have significantly reduced the amount of such territory. Hotly contested border areas, nations without states, disgruntled people within states, and undergoverned areas represent the territo- rial conditions and the associated nonstate actors that are most likely to produce</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conflict.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Second, globalization has accelerated at an exponential pace over the last few decades. Technological developments and the end of the Cold War have significantly increased global interconnectedness, espe- cially in the international movement of information, monetary value, people, and cargo. Cyberspace has both contributed to and resulted from globalization.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Third, a number of influential inter- national organizations have arisen. Over time, their organizational capabilities have matured, their roles have expanded, their legitimacy has grown, and their influence over international and national activities has increased. Such entities provide alternative forums for the communication, cooperation, and conflict resolution that have increas- ingly changed the dynamics of international interaction.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Fourth, the ways and means of violent conflict have changed radically. The advent of nuclear weapons stands out as the most sig- nificant development. Advancements in com- munications, precision-guided munitions, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance have changed the character of war.<span class="s60">7</span><span class="s61"> </span>Arms proliferation including missiles and weapons of mass destruction have placed great power  in more hands. Finally, the information age has introduced ubiquitous media reporting and cyber attack.<span class="s60">8</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Collectively, these four changes in the environment have dispersed power in the international order and altered the rules of the game for conflict resolution. Since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, nation-states have served as the primary actors in the international arena. While they will remain the most important actors for some time, the paradigm for power distribution is changing. Large states with great resources and robust</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">militaries now share a much greater portion of power with smaller states and nonstate actors, which can now create, control, and transact information, monetary value, and weaponry in significant ways and amounts. They often enjoy an advantage over larger states in access, agility, and anonymity. Furthermore, the transnational nature of many activities, ambi- guity of certain actor identities, and perceived capabilities and legitimacy of nonstate actors erode the notion of inviolable territorial integ- rity and political sovereignty.<span class="s60">9</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Simultaneously, international norms of behavior have begun to change. Paradoxically, as the acceptability of using force to resolve state-versus-state conflict diminishes, the impetus for able states to intervene elsewhere for humanitarian causes increases. The transnational nature of certain threats such</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as drug-trafficking and international violent extremism complicates traditional methods of national defense. The interconnectedness of states and nonstate actors creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities that are  not adequately addressed in existing national or international law. Nonstate actors enjoy increasing amounts of legitimacy, capability, and capacity to conduct activities previously reserved to states.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">0 </span>A greater number and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">variety of international actors may now influ- ence issues they have stakes in. Finally, due to increased interconnectedness, events in one place often have more extensive second- and third-order effects on a greater variety of enti- ties and across a larger span of the globe.

Additionally, attackers might direct strikes at particular societies, populations, or subsets. In some cases, attack- ers desire to gain some benefit for themselves without concern for the victim’s identity per se. An attack could have multiple victims.</p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The fourth factor, <i>activity</i>, addresses the action that actually constitutes a cyber attack. Actions that involve both a cyber input and output include access (for example, piracy, theft, espionage); manipulation to add, delete, or change electronic data; control of computer</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">rise of nonstate actors, the interconnectedness of activities, and the ambiguity of where cyber attack fits within existing norms contorts international rules of the game.<span class="s60">11</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Consequently, cyberspace—which is both a cause and product of this new and dynamic environment—continues to grow as a medium for international cooperation and conflict. Cyber attack not only offers  the opportunity to do new things, but it also does so in a notably different and dynamic strategic environment that demands innova- tive ways of thinking. The degree to which actors share these views and behave accord- ingly affects how they approach cyber attack issues (see figure 1). A cyber attack intended to execute a familiar task in a legacy envi- ronment is primarily a technical problem to solve. It calls for a new technique. A cyber attack reflecting newer types of activities or occurring in a new strategic environment requires not only technical innovations, but also new principles to guide operations— that is, new doctrine. Actors who believe</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the emergence of the cyber domain creates fundamentally new possibilities, especially in light of a vastly different and dynamic strategic environment, operate in boundary conditions that require pioneering ways to think about the problem—or new theory.<span class="s60">12</span><span class="s61"> </span>The steps from technique to doctrine to theory reflect nonlinear leaps in approach.<span class="s60">13</span><span class="s61"> </span>The contextual view an actor takes drives its approach to the remaining three elements of the framework and, ultimately, the character of resulting policy and strategy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><i><b>Spectrum of Cyber Attacks. </b></i>The second element of the framework involves the extent to and ways in which an actor distinguishes between different types of cyber attacks. For example, some place various cyber attacks into the categories of war, terrorism, crime, espionage, operational preparation of the environment, and so forth.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">4 </span>Others limit discussion of cyber attacks to conflicts involv- ing only computer network attacks or state actors.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">5 </span>Still others categorize cyber attacks according to their technical characteristics, lumping them into groups such as worms, viruses, and denial-of-service attacks.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">6 </span>These parameters provide useful frameworks for analysis, but they entail various biases or limi- tations. Each arranges cyber attacks by one or more of the following factors: attacker, target, victim, activity, effect, and intent. An assess- ment of these six factors provides insight into how broadly and in what ways various actors perceive the spectrum of cyber attacks.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The first factor addresses the identity of the <i>attacker</i>, who could be an individual, multinational corporation, organized armed group such as a terrorist or insurgent entity, transnational criminal organization, tradi- tional state, or international governmental organization. A mix of entities could work as sponsors, proxies, or partners, and any of the above could hire cyber attack mercenaries.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">8</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A virtual or physical <i>target</i>, the second factor, constitutes the direct object of the actions. Objects can include information itself; digital, electronic, and mechanical systems; physical items; and the people and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">processes; and denial of access, manipulation, or control by the victim. Actions could also involve cyber inputs with physical outputs such as malware that physically damages electronic devices, manipulates supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment, or controls automated, robotic, and weapons systems. Finally, actions could involve noncyber (often kinetic) input with cyber output such as severing electric power to physical components of cyberspace, physical damage to those components, and an elec- tromagnetic pulse that erases digital data or renders computing devices nonfunctional.<span class="s60">20</span><span class="s61"> </span>The activity may involve many actions in sequence or simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Activities—whether cyber-cyber, cyber- physical, or noncyber-cyber—produce effects, the fifth factor. <i>Effect </i>describes not just the immediate outcome of an attack, but also</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the associated intensity, frequency, scope, magnitude, duration, and criticality.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">1 </span>Notable thresholds include whether the attacker actu- ally changed the target or merely observed and accessed it, activated malware or only emplaced it, achieved virtual or physical outcomes, or caused physical damage includ- ing human injury or death.<span class="s60">22</span><span class="s61"> </span>This factor also encompasses second- and third-order effects<span class="s60">23</span><span class="s61"> </span>as well as unintended consequences.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">4 </span>The full extent of effects may be difficult to anticipate before an attack and measure afterward. Causal linkages and degrees of separation between action and result may be ambigu- ous.<span class="s60">25</span><span class="s61"> </span>Moreover, the nature of the attack and of the target, along with the victim’s response,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_044.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">may alter effects and a system’s resiliency to them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Finally, <i>intent </i>is the underlying purpose of the attacker in conducting a cyber attack. The attacker may desire to drive changes to political views, actions, or outcomes. Alter- natively, he may want to gain an economic benefit or deny one to the victim. The attacker may hope to deny, degrade, or destroy a military or other type of capability. Or he may just want to <i>hurt </i>the victim or cause general disruption.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">6 </span>Intent reflects the motivation.<span class="s60">27</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Collectively, the nature of the attacker, target, victim, activity, effect, and intent char- acterize where a particular cyber attack fits along the spectrum of possibilities. Different combinations of these factors may produce qualitatively different kinds of cyber attacks. Certain types of attack may be more effective in specific circumstances. They present differ- ent threats and may require different postures for deterrence and responses.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">8 </span>Either an attacker or a potential victim will necessarily focus its policy, strategy, and capabilities on an arranged subset of this spectrum. Under- standing how these actors bound and sort</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the spectrum reveals how they perceive cyber attack, both as an option and as a threat.<span class="s60">29</span><span class="s61"> </span>Among other things, how an actor scopes and arranges the spectrum drives the prioritiza- tion and relationship of a specific cyber attack relative to other kinds of cyber attack. The next key element addresses the primacy and relationship between cyber attack and other types of actions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><i><b>Balance of Focus. </b></i>The third element of the framework entails an actor’s balance of focus on cyber attack as an enabling function, an independent capability, and a strategic attack. As an enabling function, cyber attack plays a supporting role to some other form of action or operation. That is not to say that this role is necessarily unimportant; cyber attack may be the critical enabler for successful achievement of an actor’s objectives. None- theless, it is insufficient by itself.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">0 </span>The 2007 Israeli cyber attack against Syrian air defenses was such a case.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Cyber attacks can also take on identi- ties and purposes of their own, whether they are conducted exclusively or in conjunction with other types of operations. For example, disruption of an adversary’s command, control, and communications capabilities may facilitate other offensive operations, but it has an independent quality. As independent capa- bilities, cyber attacks could constitute single</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">or small-scale events with narrow objectives, focused or widespread covert operations, overt military-like campaigns between bel- ligerents, or persistent actions over extended periods to attrit an adversary’s capability or will to resist.<span class="s60">31</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Cyber attacks intended to achieve an attacker’s main objectives by striking directly at an adversary’s centers of gravity constitute strategic attacks.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">2 </span>These could take several forms. First, an attacker could use a cyber attack to detrimentally affect key infrastruc- ture, such as shutting down telecommunica- tions or the electric power grid via attacks</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on SCADA systems. The Stuxnet attack on Iran’s nuclear weapons program—notably, against a closed system not connected to the Internet—provides an example.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">3 </span>Second,  an attacker could disrupt critical civilian or military functions. Third, an attacker could destroy, disrupt, or deny use of a significant portion of cyberspace itself with major sec- ond-order effects on other critical functions. For example, Russia’s 2008 denial-of-service</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">attacks against Georgia’s Internet infrastruc- ture for 19 days degraded the target country’s military command and control, stopped</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">all electronic transactions of the National Bank for 10 days, and disrupted reporting of current events outside the country.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">4 </span>Vulner- ability to such strategic attacks varies widely by actor depending largely on the intercon- nectedness of critical infrastructure such as electric power, financial institutions, and telecommunications.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The balance of focus among these roles carries significant implications. Allocation of time, money, and expertise to develop and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">conduct various kinds of cyber attack reflects an actor’s beliefs about desirable objectives, the direct and indirect effects possible, the most efficient use of available resources, and the efficacy of cyber attack versus other suit- able instruments. The actor’s contextual views and assessment of the cyber attack spectrum will largely shape these beliefs. For example, some contend that cyber attack has “broken the evolutionary continuity of the character  of war”<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">5 </span>and could independently achieve catastrophic strategic-level damage to critical infrastructure and disruption to societies.<span class="s60">36</span><span class="s61"> </span>More skeptical analysts conclude that endur- ing and widespread catastrophic damage remains improbable in the first place, and— even if it did occur—it would be unlikely to achieve the underlying strategic goals of the attacker.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">7 </span>Others think that strategic attacks</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">are possible and even likely; however, their effects, while significant, may not be cata- strophic.<span class="s60">38</span><span class="s61"> </span>An actor’s views on the efficacy of enabling, independent, and strategic roles for cyber attack drive its allocation of resources, organizational alignments, development of theory and doctrine, and ultimately the asso- ciated policy and strategy. These views also shape the actor’s determination of when to conduct cyber attack.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Appropriate Circumstances. <span class="p">The fourth element addresses the appropriate circum- stances in which to conduct cyber attack. An actor must assess the opportunities and asso- ciated risks as well as the costs and benefits.  As circumstances vary, so will assessments of suitability and acceptability as viewed through the lenses of law, ethics, and prudence.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Through the lens of law, two fun- damental debates are under way that are interwoven and sometimes confused. The first takes a descriptive and explanatory approach to determine the legality of various cyber attacks under existing international law.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">9 </span>The second takes a normative approach to establish when and which cyber attacks <i>should </i>be lawful. Each of the six factors of the cyber attack spectrum plays a pivotal role in both debates, for delineations between legal and illegal often hinge on the particulars of one or more of those factors.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Additionally, difficulties with clear attribution complicate these judgments. Absent strong cyber attack precedent, it remains unclear how various actors will apply the principles and how such norms will evolve over time.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">1 </span>These issues become further convoluted when they involve nonstate actors. While certain components</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of international law address actions by these groups, the traditional law of armed conflict (LOAC) focuses on state-on-state engage- ment.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">2 </span>It seems plausible that some attackers will exploit this ambiguity to conduct cyber attacks in a manner they perceive to reside just below the thresholds of LOAC.<span class="s60">43</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Given the ambiguities of interpreting and applying international law, ethical norms become even more relevant. For example, even if an <i>armed conflict </i>clearly exists and a cyber attack clearly rises to the level of <i>use of force</i></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">or <i>armed attack</i>, actors will still make judg- ments in applying principles such as military necessity, proportionality, discrimination, and minimizing unnecessary human suffering in the context of cyber attacks and their associ- ated effects.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">4 </span>Ethical norms based on religious values, ethnicities, local traditions, and other</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="360" height="224" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_045.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_046.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s112" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2. Current and Desired U.S. Contextual Views of Cyber Attack</p><p class="s59" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Context. <span class="p">To the extent that prevailing</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">U.S. thinking on cyber attack has coalesced at all, it falls largely within the middle range of both the activity type and strategic envi-</p><p class="s120" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">New and Dynamic</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s122" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: left;">Strategic Enviroment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s120" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Legacy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s123" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Current</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s123" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Desired</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ronment dimensions of context. At least in public discourse, it focuses largely on cyber attacks to execute relatively familiar tasks and on certain elements of cyber security. It also tends to use the language of a legacy strategic environment dominated by state sovereignty, territorial integrity, physical interaction, and clearer distinctions between armed conflict, crime, espionage, and diplomacy.

Much (if not most) of this activity will never rise to the level of armed conflict. While other laws including the Convention on Cyber- crime, human rights law, and various national laws may apply, evolving international norms will guide how expansive or restrictive cyber attack standards become.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">6 </span>Over time, these norms will form the basis of new international rules of the game, interpretations of existing law, and creation of new law, but this process takes time.<span class="s60">47</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In addition to legal and ethical con- siderations, actors will also judge whether cyber attack in general and a specific kind in particular seems prudent. Indeed, actors may deem a cyber attack illegal and unethical and still judge it worth conducting. A number of factors may make cyber attack an appealing option. It may provide an asymmetric capabil- ity against an otherwise superior adversary. Traditional warfare is costly in treasure, lives, and political capital.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">8 </span>The low cost of entry for cyber attack allows smaller, poorer states as well as nonstate actors a seat at the table. The complexity and costs of certain high-end cyber attack operations restricts this portion of the spectrum to wealthy actors with robust capabilities; however, others can access a significant portion of the spectrum with more moderate costs and technical requirements.<span class="s60">49</span><span class="s61"> </span>Additionally, anonymity seems useful and achievable via cyber attack.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Finally, cyber</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">attack may offer the best—and perhaps only— option for achieving certain effects.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Correspondingly, a variety of factors might dissuade an actor. Cyber attack might not offer a viable solution with the desired effect and reliability. Such activity might prove politically difficult with either internal or external audiences. Cyber attack might pose unacceptable harmful conse- quences to others or oneself.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">1 </span>An attacker</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">might not want to bear the associated risk of retribution or escalation. Finally, the would- be attacker might not possess the technical capability to reliably plan or execute the desired attack. Evaluation of opportunities and risks as well as the benefits and costs would vary across actors and circumstances. However, how a particular actor perceives, weighs, and judges legal, ethical, and pru- dential considerations would guide its deter- mination of the appropriate circumstances in which to conduct cyber attacks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Implications for the United States</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This framework provides a useful tool for U.S. policymakers and strategists. Various studies and reports have suggested the United States needs national debate and a clear cyber attack policy.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">2 </span>The elements of this frame- work provide the necessary foundation for conducting such discourse and formulating national guidance. How policymakers and strategists address these four core areas should drive resolution of the many more detailed operational, technical, and organizational issues that follow from them.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">while rapidly changing—cannot provide this foundation.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">5 </span>Theory and technology should jointly drive doctrine and the national guid- ance under which it is employed.<span class="s60">56</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><i><b>Spectrum. </b></i>Such theory would almost certainly steer policymakers and strategists  to a wide-spectrum view of cyber attack. Distinctions between categories of cyber attacks such as war, terrorism, crime, and espionage—and the actors who conduct them—continue to blur.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">7 </span>Moreover, the actions required to conduct or respond to cyber attack would increasingly involve more coordinated participation by military, civilian government, private sector, and international entities.<span class="s60">58</span><span class="s61"> </span>Consequently, U.S. policy and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">strategy should address a broad range of cyber attacks including cyber-to-cyber, noncyber- to-cyber, and cyber-to-physical. The last category will gain increasing importance</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as “critical mass” is achieved in automa- tion, robotics, and machine learning.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">9 </span>Still, some threshold is necessary to focus limited</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">resources.

In other words, using the logic</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of cyber attack, one should explain how the particular attack results not only in the direct effects but also in the desired modification</p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to environmental conditions or adversarial behavior.<span class="s60">6</span><span class="s61">3 </span>To inform such evaluations, espe- cially in the absence of sufficient empirical case studies, one needs sound theory that addresses how to impose, defend, coerce, deny, compel, and deter vis-à-vis cyber attack.<span class="s60">64</span></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">If cyber attack offers a suitable option, one should assess its acceptability.

Will others perceive the attack as violent? Does it intentionally (or likely) result in human injury or death, other human suffering, physical damage or</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">tinuum (see figure 3). First, such an orienta- tion induces deeper thinking for newer types of activities where the United States stands  to gain the most and enemies could pose the greatest threat. Second, intentional focus on the strategic end has cascading benefits on</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the enabling end, where legacy organizational inertia will continue to make advances regard- less; however, the reverse is much less likely. Third, cyber attack can play a niche role as a form of coercive diplomacy somewhere short of armed attack. It may also prove itself as an asymmetric advantage against nonstate actors who are less vulnerable to kinetic strikes</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">but become more dependent on cyberspace. Both roles are more likely found on the independent and strategic attack end. Fourth, given the dynamic nature of cyber attack technology, the United States should adopt a future-oriented perspective. It is better to be constrained by technology than ideas. Finally, policymakers and strategists should devote concerted effort on the linkage between the direct effects of cyber attack and the desired political, security, and economic outcomes—a key element of more mature theory.<span class="s60">60</span></p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Circumstances. <span class="p">Determining the appro- priate circumstances in which to conduct cyber attack may prove elusive, but it could also produce the most direct consequences.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. policy should preserve the stability of international laws and norms regarding armed conflict. However, because both the strategic environment and the activities afforded by</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">norms—have changed in fundamental ways, some recalibration is required. As previously argued, the rules of the game are changing. How large a role will the United States play in what they change to?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Superpower status, allure as a target, and cyber attack capability make the United States uniquely positioned to lead that recalibration. Positions taken (or not taken) and actions conducted (or not conducted) could set precedents and sow norms with far-reaching consequences.<span class="s60">6</span><span class="s61">1 </span>Assuming a strong alignment between what is beneficial for the United States and for the rest of the world in terms of international security and stability, Washing- ton should take a normative approach. That is, policymakers should first determine what international norms <i>ought </i>to exist vis-à-vis cyber attack. Then they should emplace poli- cies to build international consensus, set prec- edent, interpret relevant existing international law, develop norms of behavior, and draft new agreements (treaty law) as appropriate to insti- tutionalize those normative determinations. In this way, the United States can lead the modernization of international law in a way that accounts for the fundamental contextual changes of cyber attack.<span class="s60">62</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Washington should maintain stability and order by limiting cyber attacks while also preserving options to conduct such attacks</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in defense of its interests. This duality exists for other forms of statecraft, especially armed conflict, but it does beg the question of when</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">destruction, or loss of critical data? What collateral damage may result? Are these effects irreversible? What is the current state of affairs and status of conflict, does tradi- tional armed conflict already exist, and to what extent does the cyber attack risk escala- tion? Does the attack involve highly sensitive areas, such as the international finance system or weapons of mass destruction, which could undermine trust, confidence, and reliability; set far-reaching negative precedent; create uncontrollable systemic repercussions; or produce otherwise taboo effects?<span class="s60">6</span><span class="s61">5 </span>Most fundamentally, does the attack contribute to or detract from long- term international security and stability as well as the norms that promote them? Given answers to these and similar questions, is the cyber attack acceptable to the United States? To the international community?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">These questions address normative legal, ethical, and prudential aspects of cyber attack that should guide U.S. policy and strategy, but answering them is difficult. Well-developed cyber policy and strategy, as with nuclear issues in the last century, will evolve over time; however, it should begin with a clear idea of <i>what </i>the United States is trying to achieve</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and <i>how </i>that might come to pass. Those ideas should be grounded in well-developed cyber attack theory, distinct understanding of the cyber attack spectrum, and appropri- ately weighted effort along the cyber attack continuum.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="697" height="372" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_049.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="220" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_050.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_051.png"/></span></p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Vice Admiral Michael Rogers, USN, commander</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 367pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: right;">U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and U.S. 10<span class="s124">th</span><span class="s125"> </span>Fleet, speaks to Information Dominance Corps Sailors at U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">National governments do not yet have well-defined cyber attack policies and strate- gies, a condition exacerbated by accelerating changes in power distribution, cyber tech- nology, and other dynamics of the strategic environment.

For the United States</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in particular, the proposed approaches to each element lay a foundation for coherently shaping national guidance and international norms. A progressive view of both new types of activities and the dynamic new strategic environment in which they occur should form the impetus for developing more com- prehensive cyber attack theory. Additionally, a wide-spectrum view that takes a more nuanced approach to categorizing cyber attacks combined with a focus toward the strategic attack end of the cyber attack con- tinuum will properly shape U.S. perspective. Consequently, such perspective will inform  a normative approach for determining the appropriate circumstances in which to conduct cyber attack, which will guide both</p><ol id="l13"><ol id="l14"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">action and modernization of interna- tional norms.

However, language in the United Nations Charter involves the manner of attack, as it was written prior to the emergence of cyber attacks when military force between state actors presented the primary threat. Some</p></li></ol><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">argue that if cyber attack effects resemble those of other military force generally considered <i>armed attack</i>, the cyber attack will likely be considered an armed attack. Similarly, if cyber attack effects resemble those of harmful actions (political, eco- nomic, or covert) that do not otherwise rise to the level of <i>use of force</i>, the cyber attack will not likely</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">be considered such.

As operations subside</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and DOD attempts to recapitalize its forces, it faces a different yet extremely critical threat: unsustainable operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost growth.

Although figure 2 also shows increases in MILPERS, procurement, and R&amp;D spending, O&amp;M costs grew faster, thus increasing the O&amp;M share of the DOD budget (figure 3). This relative growth in O&amp;M spending is squeezing out funds available for recapitalization (procurement and R&amp;D), a process sometimes referred to as a “weaken- ing of the defense dollar.”<span class="s64">4</span><span class="s65"> </span>Because of O&amp;M growth, each taxpayer dollar no longer buys the same amount of new defense capabilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Two top-level metrics exist to track and assess O&amp;M trends.

It is now considerably more expensive to support each soldier in the field.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In addition to the general growth in O&amp;M spending, after each previous major buildup O&amp;M funds never returned to their pre-surge levels (see figure 6). Prior to Vietnam, O&amp;M funding averaged approxi-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">mately $84 billion; during the postwar draw- down, it plateaued to around $100 billion (a 19 percent increase). After the 1990s peace dividend drawdown, steady-state O&amp;M funding grew another 20 percent to $120</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">billion. Thus, the postdrawdown O&amp;M budget tends to plateau approximately 20 percent above its prebuildup value. If history is any indicator, one could expect that future budget cuts would not return O&amp;M spending to its pre-9/11 state.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The continual growth of O&amp;M costs, particularly the post-9/11 explosion, has raised serious concerns. Because O&amp;M</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">spending comprises the largest share of the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. defense budget, any deep cuts <i>must </i>include significant reductions in O&amp;M. These reductions cannot be a “one time good deal”; DOD must also make core procedural and/or cultural changes to arrest the relative O&amp;M cost growth (figure 4) that is weaken- ing the defense dollar. There are several underlying causes driving these increases, depending on whether one examines steady- state growth, the wartime cost explosion, or postconflict drawdowns.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Use It or Lose It: Steady- state o&amp;M Growth</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Upon entering the main gate of nearly any operational Air Force base, one of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the first sights greeting a visitor will be a board showing progress on the flying hour program—specifically, the hours remaining to burn off before the end of the year. The goal is to use them all. The fact that these boards are so universally accepted high- lights a significant problem driving O&amp;M cost growth: the “use it or lose it” culture. Although this example is from the Air Force, that mentality is universal throughout DOD.<span class="s64">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">rewards that encourage unit-level command- ers to accomplish their assigned missions under budget. As with any cultural change, this will be difficult to implement effectively. It will require buy-in across all Services, from both commanders and the thousands of financial managers ingrained with the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">use-it-or-lose-it mentality. Accordingly, unit-level programs are likely to prove the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">most effective. Senior leaders should establish tailored savings goals for subordinate units  as well as determine incentives for achieving those goals. Lower level commanders must retain the flexibility to determine how best to achieve the prescribed goals.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">An incentive program modeled on a cost-plus-incentive fee (CPIF) type of contract might prove effective. In CPIF contracts, a contractor receives (as additional profit) a share of any savings that occur if he completes the contract under budget. A similar incentive for a commander would be to restrict initially any “quality of life” (QOL) funds, and then release them if the unit attains predetermined performance milestones under budget. The QOL funds released to the unit would be proportional to the amount saved. The intent</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="432" height="163" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_065.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="419" height="322" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_066.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="22" height="1" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_067.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_068.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is <i>not </i>to reduce the QOL funds available to the troops; rather, it is to reduce mission operat- ing costs by linking a desired reward to stated efficiency goals.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Also, this recommendation drives a requirement to possibly modify funding avail- ability at the strategic level. Because a unit would not receive its QOL funds until <i>after</i></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">it met a given milestone, there would be a lag between when it accomplished the work and when it received the reward. Across the FY break, this implies QOL funds from one year paying for milestones achieved the previous fiscal year. Especially when operating on a continuing resolution, the QOL funds may not be available for several months into the new fiscal year. Resolving implementation details would require careful consideration of how to deal with such situations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ultimately, whatever system is chosen, DOD must find a way to incentivize both  the commander and his personnel to execute the mission cost effectively. Note that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">being cost effective is not the same as being</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s112" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 4.

One might attribute this to continued growth in the number of deployed person- nel: additional troops should have meant associated O&amp;M costs. Although the number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan <i>did </i>grow over time, O&amp;M cost growth outstripped the increases in deployed personnel. For instance, between 2005 and 2008, the number of military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan increased 15 percent, but the corresponding O&amp;M costs increased 48 percent.<span class="s64">1</span><span class="s65">8 </span>Something else was the culprit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An Insatiable Appetite</p><p class="s131" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2010</p><p class="s131" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2012 (est)</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">To understand what is truly causing DOD’s huge O&amp;M costs, one must first realize that <i>the current O&amp;M growth </i>rate <i>is not significantly different than that seen during previous large-scale combat operations. </i>Figure 7 compares the wartime O&amp;M growth rates for the first Gulf War, Vietnam War, and current operations.

However, one must also put these trends into context and compare them with overall O&amp;M cost growth.

This is significant,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">but it is not nearly enough to explain the entire problem.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Similarly, the costs associated with contracted support, although they are increas- ing substantially, do not explain the entire O&amp;M growth phenomenon either. Since</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">9/11, the military has relied on increased</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">War rate (approximately $12.6 billion per year) and then increased for 1 year, and finally leveled off significantly in 1967 (more on that later). The post-9/11 operations <i>on average</i>, <i>over time </i>had the same slope as the Gulf War buildup. The difference was that the Gulf</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">War lasted less than 1 year while the post-9/11</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="459" height="1" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_072.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="462" height="4" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_073.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_074.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">growth remained unchecked for 10 years. This unrestricted wartime growth in O&amp;M costs is the crux of the current dilemma.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The near-constant post-9/11 O&amp;M growth rate equates to increasing the wartime effort by the same amount each year of opera- tions. In essence, DOD throws $12.6 billion</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">at the problem the first year; if the problem persists, DOD obviously did not apply enough effort, so it requests that same $12.6 billion, <i>plus an additional </i>$12.6 billion the next year. Still not done in the third year of conflict, DOD requests more—and so on until, after more than a decade of war, O&amp;M costs have increased $119 billion, or 89 percent. The pre- vailing military doctrine (“Powell Doctrine”)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ported Service to hijack part of the supporting Service’s budget. This is doubly beneficial for the supported Service in that it obtains more funding <i>at the expense of the other Service</i>, de facto doubling its budgetary status gain rela- tive to the other Service.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">While some might argue that these wartime expenditures were justified to reduce casualties, the fact is that “nearly half of the growth in defense spending over the past decade is unrelated to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.”<span class="s64">24</span><span class="s65"> </span>The military’s first impulse is to get what it can while the checkbook is open, which is the result of the culture, established during peacetime, that, first, does not value</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">civilian leadership exacerbates this problem: who are <i>they </i>to contradict the advice of the Nation’s most experienced military person- nel?<span class="s64">2</span><span class="s65">6 </span>One of the fundamental principles underpinning America’s concept of civilian control over its military—that civilian leaders determine how much blood and treasure the Nation will expend to achieve its objectives— has broken down.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Post-9/11, the one civilian leader with significant defense experience who pushed back on the military plans—Donald Rums- feld—was vilified by both the military and media as a micromanager.<span class="s64">2</span><span class="s65">7 </span>They ignored the fact that <i>Rumsfeld’s establishment of limits</i></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">reinforces this tendency to continually ask for more. The Powell Doctrine states that if the United States is going to use military force, it should do so overwhelmingly and crush the enemy.<span class="s64">1</span><span class="s65">9 </span>The inverted implication is that, if</p><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">the root cause of the wartime cost growth is simply  an insatiable DOD appetite that remains unchecked by system-intrinsic incentives and the military culture</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">we have not yet crushed the enemy, we have not yet applied enough military force. Like Oliver Twist, the military has a predisposition to continually ask for more as long as combat operations persist.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">For example, consider the Army’s desire for full-motion video support (from the Air Force) in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force supplied 10 Predator Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) in 2007 but the Army wanted more.<span class="s64">20</span><span class="s65"> </span>A goal was agreed on to obtain 21 CAPs by 2010, which the Air Force reached in 2008.<span class="s64">21</span><span class="s65"> </span>The Army wanted more. DOD allocated an additional $2 billion to boost the number to 50 CAPs by 2011.<span class="s64">2</span><span class="s65">2 </span>The Army wanted more. The current goal is 65 CAPs by 2013 and about 125 by the end of the decade.<span class="s64">2</span><span class="s65">3 </span>Throughout these increases, the Air Force—not the Army—paid the bill in both dollars and manpower. As a result, there was no incentive for the Army to curb its ever-increasing requests for additional support. The intent is not to berate the Army. This example is simply well documented and highlights a key structural problem with cost control in joint operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Specifically, the supported-supporting construct within joint operations does not contain natural incentives to curb the appe- tite of a supported Service. The supported Service can continually ask for more, and the supporting Service pays the bill. In fact, some may argue that the Pentagon culture actually incentivizes the supported Service</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to ask for more. If the Services view the DOD budget as a zero-sum game, uncontrolled resource requests essentially allow the sup-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">executing the mission under cost and, second, rewards those who can bring in external funds to bolster their unit’s budget. Thus,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the (primary) root cause of the wartime cost growth is simply an insatiable DOD appetite that remains unchecked by system-intrinsic incentives and the military culture. It there- fore falls on the civilian leadership (including but not limited to the President, Secretary</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of Defense, and Congress) to repulse the onslaught of defense funding requests, but their ability to do that during wartime is politically tenuous.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The failure in Vietnam effectively neutered the civilian leadership’s ability to reject military wartime resource requests. As mentioned briefly above, one can see in figure 7 that the Vietnam O&amp;M expenditure rate tapered off significantly in 1967. One might believe this indicates that the “Oliver Twist” theory presented herein is flawed and that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the 1967 leveling off occurred naturally. But  in 1967, General William Westmoreland <i>had </i>asked for more but President Lyndon Johnson denied his request.<span class="s64">2</span><span class="s65">5 </span>The most significant outcome of this denial was that when the United States lost Vietnam, the civilian leader- ship suffered a reduction in political control over the military. No wartime President (or Congress) wants to appear as withholding resources requested by the military, thereby taking unnecessary casualties and risking another defeat, especially in a limited war where the country is not fully mobilized and has apparent Reserve forces to spare. The lack of military credentials within the current</p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on the allocated resources was part of his job. <span class="p">Rumsfeld’s failure was not a result of limiting the resources allocated to the Iraq War; rather, it was not pushing the military for a workable strategy to secure the peace within the exist- ing resource constraints (developing alternate solutions that adjusted the ends or ways to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">fit the means available) and not challeng- ing the assumptions on which U.S. Central</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Command based its “Phase 4” planning.<span class="s64">2</span><span class="s65">8 </span>Yet the resultant struggles in Iraq reinforced the military’s “we told you we needed more” atti- tude. With the country wary of finding itself in another Vietnam, military leaders recog- nized the leverage they possessed and pushed for additional resources. President George W. Bush eventually approved a 2007 “surge” in Iraq. By leaking its Afghanistan surge request the following year, the military effectively forced President Barack Obama (who had promised to scale down the two wars) to concede to its demands as well.<span class="s64">2</span><span class="s65">9 </span>In short,</p><ol id="l19"><ol id="l20"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">civilian leaders’ inability to suppress their military’s insatiable wartime appetite was the principal driver behind the post-9/11 escala- tion in O&amp;M costs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Foundation of Any Diet: Changing one’s eating Habits</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Based on the above discussion, con- straining DOD O&amp;M expenditures during long-duration conflicts may appear to require a restoration of the civilian leadership’s politi- cal ability to say “no” to military resource requests. However, that would require the President and Congress to receive advice from</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_075.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a source that can effectively challenge a com- batant command’s war plans, and doing so is more difficult than it sounds. As a result, the solution is, once again, to change the underly- ing DOD culture to promote development of cost-effective solutions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The President already has an indepen- dent advisor to review combatant command plans: U.S. law tasks the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) to review contin- gency plans.<span class="s64">3</span><span class="s65">0 </span>However, based on the results since 9/11, this arrangement is obviously not effective at controlling the costs of conflict. The same chains that shackle combatant command staffs also bind the CJCS offices: they have all matured in the same culture that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">promotes the use of “overwhelming force” and does not incentivize or reward cost-effective- ness. As a result, Joint Staff members tend to view the problem through the same lens and gravitate toward the same solutions as the combatant command staffs. This similarity</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in viewpoints also ties into the second major problem, which is that any effective critique of the war plans must include “not just an evaluation of the means actually employed, but of <i>all possible means </i>. . . one can, after all, not condemn a method without being able  to suggest a better alternative.”<span class="s64">3</span><span class="s65">1 </span>Today’s war plans are so complex that maintaining the ability to suggest effective alternate solutions across all combatant commands simultane- ously would require a monstrous, untenable Joint Staff.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A new, independent body might appear to be an alternate solution. Naval War College professor John Garofano previously identified a similar problem with the President obtain- ing genuinely independent advice regarding <i>when </i>to go to war.<span class="s64">3</span><span class="s65">2 </span>One might propose expanding his “President’s Advisory Board  on the Use of Force” concept to examine <i>how</i></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the military plans to go to war, not just <i>when </i>it should go. Although this idea would mitigate the cultural bias inherent in the CJCS staff, it would suffer from the same problems regard- ing the size of the staff required to submit feasible alternative solutions.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In addition, from an efficiency stand- point, a review by either the CJCS or an independent panel is “non-value-added work,” or overhead in Lean Six-Sigma parlance.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Such a review adds extra steps to the war plan production process without adding significant value to the final plan. Without the ability</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to propose effective alternate solutions, an oversight body’s only real purpose and ability</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is to say “no—this is wrong, go fix this,” so over time the process will, on average, become slower. This is obviously not desirable, par- ticularly for contingency planning. In addi- tion, from a process efficiency point of view, the goal should not be to make such a review effective, but to eliminate the need for it alto- gether. The solution is to make the initial war plans cost effective from the start.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Therefore, to constrain wartime O&amp;M cost growth, the solution is similar to that required to fix the steady-state growth problem: DOD must change its underly-  ing culture. The department must train its combatant command staffs to consider cost effectiveness as a metric when assessing proposed courses of action. It must develop an incentive system that encourages staffs</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to produce resource-constrained plans from the outset. Developing this culture during normal steady-state operations will be vital to establishing the foundation upon which to build during wartime contingencies. The resulting minimization of wartime cost growth should produce a side benefit as well: it would minimize the impacts of any post- conflict drawdown.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Battle after the War: Postconflict Drawdown</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As discussed previously (figure 6), during a postbuildup drawdown, the O&amp;M budget has a tendency to stabilize approxi- mately 20 percent above its value preceding the surge. Because all three Services possess aging weapons systems that require recapital- ization, it becomes imperative to restore the balance between the operations and invest- ment accounts.<span class="s64">3</span><span class="s65">3 </span>O&amp;M currently consumes 43 percent of DOD’s budget (see figure 3). Based on DOD’s projected postdrawdown budget (figure 1), “resetting” O&amp;M to a 30 percent share (the level seen during the 1980s, the last period of major recapitalization) provides a target O&amp;M budget of approximately $130 billion, its pre-9/11 value.<span class="s64">3</span><span class="s65">4 </span>Therefore, to support its recapitalization plans, DOD must break its habit of stabilizing O&amp;M costs at a higher plateau after each drawdown.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">From a purely budgetary perspective, the solution is simple: cut O&amp;M deeper than desired. This, however, is easier said than done. We already see DOD leaders pushing back against potential cuts, attempting to anchor the debate at the “new normal.”<span class="s64">35</span><span class="s65"> </span>Despite the fact that the DOD budget has nearly doubled in the past 10 years, they claim</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">anything more than a 10–15 percent cut will make the force “hollow.” Determining where to make O&amp;M cuts is also difficult because the O&amp;M budget finances such a wide variety of items. It is nearly impossible to determine where to apply massive cuts using a “bottom up” approach.<span class="s64">3</span><span class="s65">6 </span>Therefore, DOD must imple- ment cuts using a top-down methodology and align them with its planned strategic posture.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">While a detailed suggestion of which programs should face reductions is well beyond the scope of this analysis, logically the Army O&amp;M account should absorb the brunt of the cuts. Between 2001 and 2011, the Army O&amp;M budget grew 251 percent, the Navy and Marine Corps 58 percent, and the Air Force 56 percent.<span class="s64">3</span><span class="s65">7 </span>In addition, the “pivot to the Pacific” strategy is highly weighted toward capabilities provided by the Navy and Air Force. With a goal of returning O&amp;M spend- ing to the pre-9/11 levels, the Army’s account therefore becomes the obvious primary target.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">With a requirement to recapital- ize its forces after 10 years of continuous</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">combat, and do it during a period of massive budget reductions, DOD must take action now to halt its runaway O&amp;M spending.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In the short term, the current drawdown must reduce expenditures back to their pre-9/11 levels. Longer term, DOD must instill a culture that values, incentivizes,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and rewards its personnel for achieving the desired mission results, but under budget. Such a culture would arrest the slow but steady growth of O&amp;M as a percentage of DOD’s budget that has led to a “weakening of the defense dollar.” This culture will also foster the creativity required to execute long-duration wartime operations in a cost- effective manner. The civilian leadership’s ability to say no to the military is limited politically during wartime, and the military must stop taking advantage of that fact. The Nation simply cannot afford its military’s insatiable appetite for “more.” Instilling a culture during peacetime that values cost- effective solutions will provide the founda- tion on which to curb this appetite. Finally, as DOD continues the drawdown in the Middle East, it must “reset” O&amp;M spending to pre-9/11 levels in order to reclaim funds needed for recapitalization and moderniza- tion. Because of the large O&amp;M cost growth since 9/11, this means cuts must be deeper than currently planned. The resulting</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">changes require DOD to restructure the way it normally does business, making today the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="220" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_076.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_077.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">perfect time to begin establishing a culture that values and promotes cost-effectiveness within the department.

Despite its use of Taliban-controlled territory, it did not operate as a terrorist arm of the Afghan state nor did it conduct its activities on behalf of the Taliban. Rather, the group behaved much like a cult, acting upon its leader’s premise that attacking the United States would force U.S. withdrawal from the Islamic world. Its members fanati- cally followed its leader without any objective measurement of his logic or effectiveness.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Osama bin Laden made no secret about his desire that al Qaeda serve as the vanguard for violent revolutionary movements in the Muslim world.<span class="s64">3</span><span class="s65"> </span>Nonetheless, to take his ambi- tion seriously would have grossly inflated the capacity of the organization and the credibil- ity of his ideas. This challenge left Washington with little choice but to center its war machine on destroying al Qaeda’s terrorist capabilities, which in turn led to the second paradox.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The counterterrorist agenda of the war on al Qaeda created the expectation that preventing the group from conducting ter- rorist operations against U.S. interests would be the critical indicator of the group’s defeat. The problem with this premise is that it also created the logical argument that any al Qaeda terrorist operation would become an indicator of its victory. Neither is necessarily true. Pre- venting terrorism is a noble goal, but the tactic of terrorism will remain an easy-to-employ, violent method adopted by the few to obtain the immediate attention of the many. There will be no unconditional surrender by a tactic. Making terrorism prevention the objective of war increases the potential for an endless state of conflict, given that even a failed terrorist</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">attempt reignites the battlefield.</p><p class="s119" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 61pt;text-align: left;">W</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">hen the United States began its war on al Qaeda in September 2001, the objective was to destroy</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the group by eliminating its leadership, dislodging the group from Afghanistan, and preventing future al Qaeda terrorist opera- tions.<span class="s64">1</span><span class="s65"> </span>Americans also hoped to reduce the appeal of al Qaeda’s message, particularly among the populations the group targeted for recruitment and support. Washington viewed these goals as representing victory in the war on terror, or at least the war on al Qaeda.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This concept of victory against al Qaeda differed, however, from the group’s vision of its own defeat, and according to terrorism experts such as Peter Bergen, this critical disconnect continues to obscure whether the war is over.<span class="s64">2</span><span class="s65"> </span>The disparity resulted from several inextri- cable paradoxes, the first of which emerged early when the highly publicized term <i>war </i>unintentionally elevated al Qaeda’s stature to that of a state enemy. But since al Qaeda was not a traditional enemy, conventional concepts of defeating one’s foe through annihilation or attrition may never have fully applied to it.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Events over the past decade further illuminate this dilemma. American-led opera- tions in Afghanistan crushed al Qaeda’s lead- ership, reduced its ranks, and dislodged the group.<span class="s64">4</span><span class="s65"> </span>Continued pressure has prevented the group from reconsolidating its presence and is close to destroying the entirety of the original leadership. The group survives only by living underground and on the move.

The group’s committed members believe time is on their side because as long</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as one man inspired by al Qaeda can pose a threat, the United States by its own definition cannot claim victory.<span class="s60">6</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In addition to inadvertently raising an expectation that every terrorist attack could be prevented, Washington’s counter- terrorism focus in its war on al Qaeda may have minimized other avenues for defeat- ing the group, leading to a third paradox. Dismissing the credibility of bin Laden’s vision of global insurgency unintentionally led to overlooking developments that were destroying the cohesion of the group and defeating its ideology.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The raid on bin Laden’s safe house in Pakistan in 2011 included the capture of letters between bin Laden and his subordi- nates that provided a fuller picture of inter- nal discord over al Qaeda strategy.<span class="s60">7</span><span class="s61"> </span>These documents along with detailed accounts of bin Laden by Peter Bergen and Steve Coll offered a more comprehensive picture of his grand strategy and revealed the relatively minor role terrorism played in it.<span class="s60">8</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Bin Laden’s vision of a global struggle appears to be a poorly applied interpretation of Maoist protracted warfare theory.<span class="s60">9</span><span class="s61"> </span>His writings revealed that he made a priority</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of methodically organizing his followers and creating safe enclaves for jihadist rule for others to emulate. Over time, he grew to appreciate that his followers should</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">not attack until they were in a position of strength against local security forces. Bin Laden’s strategic focus, therefore, was on changing the balance of power between local Islamic militant groups and the regimes  they sought to overthrow. Terrorist attacks against the United States were his preferred method for shifting that balance.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In his final years, bin Laden continually urged his leaders and affiliates to attack the American homeland rather than U.S. interests throughout the Muslim world. His letters strongly cautioned that striking American regional interests would only foster closer ties between Washington and the local regimes and justify an expanded U.S. role in the region.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Furthermore, bin Laden warned that launching jihad against local governments before jihadists were unified would provoke</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">destructive infighting and risk significant Muslim bloodshed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">By the mid-2000s, al Qaeda members largely resisted bin Laden’s direction to stay focused on the U.S. homeland.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">1 </span>Their severely constrained operating environ- ment along with a hardened America may</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">have deterred them from following his lead. Moreover, the group relaxed cumbersome bureaucratic requirements for establish-  ing affiliates, which ultimately produced a substantial disconnect between bin Laden’s emphasis on attacking the U.S. homeland and the preferences of the affiliates for attacks in their local areas of operation.<span class="s60">12</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Against this fuller understanding of the divide over strategy, the emergence of the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">“Arab Spring” may have played a more promi- nent role in driving al Qaeda toward defeat than was apparent at the outset. Just before his death, bin Laden cautioned that the Arab Spring could create the belief among Muslim populations that an Islamic revolution was possible without the expulsion of U.S. influ- ence in the Middle East and without the use of violence.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">3 </span>Both of those conditions would deeply discredit his theory.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The greatest challenge to the affiliate groups might be the emergence of popular political Islamic groups in transitioning Middle East nations that reject bin Laden’s extreme version of Islamic rule while advocat- ing a greater role for Islam in governance. In internal discussions, al Qaeda leaders have recognized that differences over Islamic jurisprudence between indigenous Islamic militants and al Qaeda in places such as Egypt, Libya, and Syria could be irreconcilable disputes that would prevent al Qaeda from making lasting inroads.<span class="s60">14</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This fuller picture of the divide that emerged over bin Laden’s strategy reveals a fourth paradox. To follow his course of clan- destinely organizing and exercising patience risks rendering the group’s ideology irrelevant during the greatest modern-day period of revolution in the region. To maintain even minimal currency, the group must be engaged in action. But because al Qaeda rejects par- ticipation in political processes that it does  not dictate, it leaves itself with few options for action other than terrorism. However, terror- ist attacks provoke precisely the collaboration of regional players, popular opposition move- ments, and the United States that bin Laden feared as an existential threat to the organiza- tion. Because these groups are not following</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">his vision, their validity as an extension of the original al Qaeda—and the level of threat it once posed—is questionable.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Today, the world could conclude that regional affiliates are destroying the al Qaeda of bin Laden by choosing to adopt exactly the provocative, high-visibility strategy he coun- seled against. Alternately, a political party or candidate using the moniker al Qaeda could represent the final death blow to bin Laden’s vision. Either way, changes in the Middle East may not lead to bin Laden’s caliphate but could still produce a region of states whose governments include more Islamic rule than</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the previous set of autocrats. Furthermore, the threat of al Qaeda may be around for decades even while the group and its ideas continue to weaken, just as anarchists, fascists, Nazis, and other fringe groups whose vanguard leaders dominated the world’s political and military agenda many decades ago continue to exist and inspire occasional tragedies. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">No t e S</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l22"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">“George W.

Such imperatives spell out clear requirements that any reconnaissance and surveillance (R&amp;S) organization must meet to perform across the range of military operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As the insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan developed and tactical head- quarters became increasingly static, organic</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. Army R&amp;S assets were reinforced by national resources. In fact, the Army was fortunate and had first priority on many of the Nation’s strategic intelligence assets,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">such as those provided by the Defense Intel- ligence Agency, Central Intelligence Agency,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and National Reconnaissance Office. As long as the U.S. strategic focus remained on transnational terrorist threats, the Army could rely on these assets to fill most, if not all, of the gaps within its own R&amp;S infra- structure. Moreover, Army investments in tactical R&amp;S assets (for example, Shadow unmanned aerial systems or organic recon- naissance squadrons within Brigade Combat Teams [BCTs]) gave our tactical command- ers—brigade level and below—unprec- edented R&amp;S capability.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As the U.S. presence in Afghanistan concludes and the strategic rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific region gathers momentum, the Army will no longer have first call on the Nation’s strategic R&amp;S capacity. As a result, much of the capability provided by national resources is returning</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">assets ensures its ability to see and act on the close-in battlefield will persist. But the loss of these strategic assets, coupled with the inherent limitations of tactical assets, has left a huge operational-level gap in the Army’s ability to contribute R&amp;S capabili- ties at echelons above brigade. In any future conflict or contingency, Army and joint force operational commanders will find that they lack the ability to see beyond the tacti- cal horizon, making it nearly impossible to determine enemy intent and counter it in a timely manner. Such blindness establishes conditions for battlefield surprise and risks defeat for U.S. forces.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In the past, the Army’s contribution  for operational-level R&amp;S was provided by  its Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR).

Fortunately, the Army’s investment in tactical R&amp;S</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ACR was a nearly perfect tool. Unfortu- nately, the optimization of the ACR for a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="654" height="13" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_084.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">particular environment meant that it lacked the adaptability to meet many of the R&amp;S challenges manifesting themselves across the current range of military operations. To meet these varied challenges, the Army built the Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (BfSB). Though these units proved highly effective</p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">mation <span class="p">that commanders can take action on.

This task will fall to Army R&amp;S organizations that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is increasingly obvious that they are not robust enough to “fight for intent” and survive on the future</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="462" height="4" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_085.png"/></span></p><p class="s79" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: center;">reconnaissance and surveillance allow the</p><p class="s79" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: center;">commander to shape the future battlefield to give U.S. forces the best chance of success</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">battlefield, particularly in close contact with        <u>                                                                                                                                                                        </u></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the enemy. Just as crucially, the BfSB, as well</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as other smaller maneuver R&amp;S formations, lack the intelligence fusion and analysis capability that senior operational command- ers require. As a result, the Army is making a new appraisal of the R&amp;S capabilities required to support campaigns at echelons above brigade, as well as how to obtain them during a prolonged period of austerity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Purpose</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The raison d’être of an operational- level R&amp;S organization is fighting for intent. This idea goes far beyond just gaining and maintaining contact, which any tactically proficient maneuver unit can accomplish. Rather, it entails looking over the horizon not only to see an enemy’s dispositions</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and activities, but also to interpret them. Although R&amp;S missions will often result in contact and engagement with the enemy, fighting for information remains second- ary to seeing the entire battlefield and then taking the resulting huge flow of data and turning it into a useful product that allows us to ascertain the enemy’s intent.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Operational-level R&amp;S organiza- tions thus require the capability to make sense of what they collect. Our collection capabilities already provide more data than our headquarters and commanders can make sense of or use effectively. Such massive amounts of data are useless if they cannot be placed within the context of the mission and environment. Consequently,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">operational-level R&amp;S organizations must be capable of providing at least an initial level of analysis that meets the needs of multiple supported headquarters simultaneously. Therefore, they need to have the technical resources and trained personnel to allow for the discovery of enemy intent, as well as to spot patterns, trends, and discontinuities. In short, operational-level R&amp;S organizations require sufficient analytical capability to turn huge volumes of <i>data </i>into useful <i>infor-</i></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">battle. This capability gives R&amp;S units the ability to integrate intelligence and opera- tions, thereby enabling intelligence-driven activities within commands.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have clearly demonstrated the tremendous power of this approach. By underpinning campaigns with fused intelligence analysis, the Army was able to adapt in order to  defeat a versatile and changing enemy, and did so with a degree of precision previously unknown in warfare. Moreover, our intel- ligence dominance enabled commanders to anticipate the enemy, seize the initiative, and mitigate risk across the environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Finally, since the joint force will func- tion anywhere along the range of military operations, R&amp;S organizations must be capable of gaining information in a large number of different situations. Some situa- tions will be low threat, but in some cases, the organization will have to fight for infor- mation. We can say with certainty that R&amp;S organizations require sophisticated organic intelligence capability and some degree of combat-support capability. (The question</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is how much combat capability should be organic to the organization.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">R&amp;S and a Smaller Army</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Few doubt that the Army will soon find itself substantially smaller than it is today. Whether we have 32 or 45 BCTs avail- able, the American people still expect the Army to be ready for any contingency and to emerge victorious from any conflict. Doing so requires mitigating the operational and strategic risks that a smaller force entails. Effective R&amp;S is essential to that effort.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">On the battlefield, a commander must be able to concentrate effects to counter an enemy move or achieve desired purpose.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In a smaller Army, any such concentration means other sectors—many of them impor- tant—will, of necessity, be denuded of forces.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">require the capability to sustain themselves in prolonged combat situations. In fact, the necessity for a new operational-level R&amp;S formation is specifically due to the current BfSB’s inability to maneuver and conduct combat operations throughout the depth of the battlefield.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">But an operational-level R&amp;S organiza- tion cannot be limited to fulfilling Army needs. In almost all future engagements, the Army will find itself as part of a joint force, and likely a multinational one, and may be called upon to provide R&amp;S capabilities to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">a joint task force commander. Accordingly, any future operational-level R&amp;S organiza- tion must possess the capabilities necessary for plugging into a joint headquarters.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">That support could range from serving as the R&amp;S organization for the joint force to providing niche capabilities that can work directly for headquarters.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Regional alignment can create a  strong reinforcing relationship here. An operational-level R&amp;S organization, with greater depth of intelligence capabilities as well as combat forces that can support part- nered activities, is almost ideal for training, advisory, and assistance missions. The orga- nization’s intelligence capability allows it to maintain a much deeper understanding of the environment than traditional brigades. That focus allows it to rapidly prepare units</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to operate in the environment. Furthermore, the close relationship between combat bat- talions and the intelligence organizations should lead to better prepared units. Indeed, with regional alignment, these units’ deep knowledge and unique sets of skills make them desirable for the early phases of many scenarios that combatant commanders face.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Reconnaissance and surveillance allow the commander to shape the future battle- field to give U.S. forces the best chance of success. Such shaping is impossible unless operational commanders can see what is</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="697" height="311" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_086.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s141" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COMMENTARY <span class="s142">|</span><span class="s143">  Reconnaissance and Surveillance </span><span><img width="374" height="13" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_087.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s128" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Army (Phil Kernisan)</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 397pt;text-indent: -5pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Battlefield Surveillance Brigade Soldiers speak with members of Afghan Border Police near Ulagay, Kandahar Province</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">coming at them with enough clarity to determine the enemy’s intent. That requires combat power, which allows R&amp;S organiza- tions to fight for information, protect widely dispersed assets in lower intensity opera- tions, and support the regional partnership activities that provide insight only gained  by physical proximity. Some combat power can be tailored based upon mission require- ments, but clearly the operational-level R&amp;S organization needs more organic combat power than the current BfSB.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Solutions</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">What is clear is that the Army needs to provide the joint force an R&amp;S organiza- tion that is <i>tailorable</i>. In some instances, the formation will need a great deal of combat power; in other cases, analytical capability</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">will be central. Many missions will require a unique blend of specialized capabilities. The power in this formation will stem from its mission-specific adaptability. Unfortunately, an Army of 32 BCTs cannot afford to create new specialty formations. There simply is  no latitude within the future force structure to build the modern-day equivalent of the Armored Cavalry Regiment. Worse, when</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a future conflict does erupt, the possibility of building effective operational-level R&amp;S units on the fly by simply drawing in pieces of other units into an ad hoc formation is, at best, doubtful.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The requirements discussed, however, do seem to point to a BCT-based solution. BCTs have the right combat power and a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">robust staff. If these BCTs are augmented— perhaps built around a Military Intelligence Battalion—they possess the inherent adapt- ability to meet the majority of R&amp;S require- ments. Based upon specific missions, they can receive additional units—such as chemi- cal, fires, or aviation, when necessary—and possess the seniority of leadership to work directly for a joint force commander.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Two possible solutions have emerged in discussions. First, several current BCTs can be given a permanent on-order mission to assume operational-level R&amp;S tasks. These BCTs would be augmented with additional resources and capabilities, particularly for the conduct of battlefield analytics. They would live together and build the habitual relationships that historically improve cooperation between units. Moreover, they would have adjusted training and leader development plans to ensure they maintain  a specific minimum capability to conduct operational-level R&amp;S missions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The second possibility is to assign this mission, as necessary, to any available BCT and then build R&amp;S capabilities into that unit during the Army Force Generation process. The Army would keep stores of up- to-date equipment on hand and plug it into the units as soon as they enter the process. Beyond the necessary equipment stores, the Army will have to invest in maintaining cadres of specialty personnel that can either plug into the selected BCT, or rapidly train that BCT in R&amp;S tasks. By extension, this means the Army will keep on hand the rel-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">evant doctrine and training material neces- sary to ease the organizational transition.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">These findings are informative, but  not comprehensive. There are fiscal and force structure realities that must be con- sidered, too, and the ideal solution may not be affordable. Both solutions merit further examination through analysis, experimenta- tion, and testing. The Maneuver Center of Excellence, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center, is running a series of simu- lations and exercises to test both concepts thoroughly, and eventually we must test these ideas “in the dirt.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A dangerous reconnaissance and surveillance gap is developing between what the joint force requires in the future and what the Army is likely to have available. If we are to succeed against the many dynamic and dangerous threats already rising in an increasingly chaotic global environment, seeing beyond the horizon and determin- ing enemy intent will be critical. Moreover, as strategic R&amp;S assets are redeployed to address other priorities, it is incumbent on the Army to replace these capabilities within its own structure. Unfortunately, given the austere economic situation, there are no easy answers. We can no longer solve problems by throwing money at them and building new resources. However, we can optimize existing organizations to ensure our com- manders have the right mix of forces to prevent, shape, and, when necessary, win on any future battlefield. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_088.png"/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Air Force (Eric Harris)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">RQ-4 Global Hawk was designed for intelligence,</p><p class="s44" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">surveillance, and  reconnaissance</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s145" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">ISR Support to Operational Access <span class="s146">Winning Initiative in Antiaccess and Area-denial Environments</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s147" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By  <span class="s148">A n d R e W   R o b e R t  M A R v i n </span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s149" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 61pt;text-align: left;">W</p><p class="s150" style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">hen General Martin Dempsey released the Joint Operational</p><p class="s150" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 70pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Access Concept (JOAC) in January 2012, it represented a strategic shift within the Department of Defense (DOD) following more than a decade</p><p class="s150" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of focus on irregular warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Potential foes have many weapons, but their plans will hinge on just a few of them. These few weapons will form the enemy’s high-value target (HVT) list. American ISR must focus on finding</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;">Andrew Robert Marvin is a Management Consultant for IBM Global Business Services in Chantilly, Virginia, where he conducts quantitative assessments of military operations and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets.

While not all A2/AD threats are as elusive as HVIs, there is reason to believe they will challenge existing ISR capabilities. In the JOAC, air defense tops the list of potential aerial-denial threats. Inte- grated air defense systems (IADS) are largely static, relying on large radar sets, ground control intercept stations, and large surface- to-air missiles (SAMs) that are difficult to move. Some of these assets can be identified and plotted preconflict. For instance, a SAM battery defending a key airfield is unlikely to move once detected. The United States made short work of air defenses in Iraq and Libya during recent conflicts, yet these nations had antiquated IADS. Newer SAMs, even long- range missiles such as the Russian S-400,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">are more mobile than the decades-old SA-5s</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The thinking about ISR employment in an A2/AD environment is not mature. The JOAC spends only a few paragraphs out of 70 pages on intelligence. Other valuable works on A2/AD, such as Mark Gunzinger and Christopher Dougherty’s valuable descrip- tion of possible operations in the Persian Gulf,<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61"> </span>discuss maneuver more than intelli- gence. DOD leadership must ensure that ISR and processing, exploitation, and dissemina- tion (PED) capabilities properly support and map to an operational access campaign or the concept will fail. This success must start with more thinking and debate on intelli- gence missions in A2/AD environments.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The intelligence function’s task in an operational access campaign will be tough. Not only must intelligence find HVTs central to A2/AD, but it must do that in a high-threat environment where ISR assets can be destroyed or spoofed. Assuming a collection platform succeeds and actually survives long enough to exfiltrate its data, analysts must then produce and disseminate all-source intelligence rapidly enough for friendly firepower, which is also vulner-  able to A2/AD assets, to use it. The intel- ligence function must juggle these tasks as well as traditional responsibilities such as intelligence preparation of the operational environment, situational awareness, and counterintelligence. To make matters more challenging, a JTF executing an operational access campaign could face competition for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">scarce intelligence collection and production assets from other contingency operations as</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">well as demands from political leaders who need to stay abreast of the situation. During Operation <i>Odyssey Dawn</i>, the Air Force’s only Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System unit was already committed to flights in Afghanistan when it was called to provide aircraft and crews to support operations in Libya, putting additional stress on an already heavily used capability.<span class="s60">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This article proposes a framework for analyzing intelligence support, and ISR in particular, in support of the JOAC. While the intelligence mission is universal—to drive operations through the provision of actionable information to commanders—its tools are not. What worked in Afghanistan, or even in Libya, might not work in a future operational access campaign. By thinking about operational access theory, we can imagine exactly what we want ISR to do, freeing ourselves (just enough) from past paradigms, doctrine, field manuals, and joint staff acquisition processes that are either overprescriptive or unhelpfully vague when applied to future problems. Finally, in addition to putting forward the <i>attributes  </i>of good operational access ISR (the <i>what </i>in</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">these future campaigns), this article seeks to contribute to the <i>how </i>side of the equation by offering methods to assess and measure the size and composition of a future intelligence warfighting function.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Future Battlefield</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">When Operation <i>Iraqi Freedom </i>transi- tioned from invasion to counterinsurgency,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fielded by Libya.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Also, mobile systems that combine transporter, erector, launcher, and radar (TELAR) into one vehicle have grown more sophisticated. Mobile SAMs can operate autonomously or take cues from surviving target acquisition or even civil air control radar. If not initially destroyed in garrison, these weapons can become a persistent threat to U.S. aircraft, prevent- ing the deployment of slower aircraft such as unmanned aerial systems (UASs) and AC-130 gunships, while forcing jets to operate at higher altitudes. If U.S. ground forces are engaged, such systems can pose a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">significant threat to aircraft performing the demanding close air support mission.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Surface-to-surface missiles (SSMs) with ranges in excess of 1,000 nautical miles pose a serious antiaccess threat under the terms of the JOAC. Potential SSM threats can follow either cruise or ballistic trajec- tories and can be launched from land, sea, or air. Even with conventional warheads,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">these weapons can threaten the staging areas needed for a campaign. Given proper target- ing (including fully autonomous terminal stages), high speed, and sizable warheads, such weapons can even threaten U.S. carri- ers. Truck-mounted missiles or transporter erector launchers (TELs) can provide this missile the same capability to hide, launch, and disappear (“shoot and scoot”) that modern SAM TELARs possess.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">America’s record in countering mobile SSMs is mixed. Iraqi Scuds were high prior-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ity targets during Operation <i>Desert Storm</i>. To find them, the coalition scoured potential launch areas with both special operations forces (SOF) and tactical aircraft loitering over kill boxes. These efforts likely had some impact. Scud attacks declined from 4.3 per day during the war’s first week to 1.5 per day thereafter, but evidence suggests the coali- tion actually destroyed few TELs but many decoys.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61"> </span>After the war, Saddam Hussein still had a sizable Scud force to declare to United Nations weapons inspectors.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">While ISR has improved significantly since 1991, experience in Libya and Iraq indicates that killing f leeting targets is still difficult. During the 2008 battle for Sadr City, rocket attacks launched by Iraqi insur- gents proved so difficult to interdict that ground forces resorted to walling off sec- tions of the city to prevent further attacks. Future foes may take their cues from Sadr City’s rocket teams and hide their TELs in complex terrain instead of the f lat environs of Anbar Province. Enemy IADS and air forces will likely be tougher as well. Under existing ISR regimes, search and strike sorties dedicated to neutralize these potent weapons would be sorely missed as a range of other A2/AD threats engages U.S. forces.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intelligence Fundamentals for JOAC</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The JOAC’s response to evolving IADS, SSM, and other A2/AD threats is to count</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on increased cross-domain synergy of U.S. warfighting capabilities in order to gain a temporary exploitable advantage over the enemy—a swift effort to open the portal wide enough to allow victory. The JOAC calls for combat power both applied directly against enemy A2/AD threats and employed across great distances by way of a hardened long-distance supply chain.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">While cross-domain synergy implies a variety of shooters (emerging capabilities may, for instance, allow SOF, submarines, or cyber assets to effectively neutralize an enemy IADS), the task and purpose are clear: enemy A2/AD assets need to go down</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">long enough to support maneuver against an objective. This hard requirement creates two intelligence missions: effective search and actionable fusion.</p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Effective search <span class="p">refers to the collection of A2/AD asset signatures to support target- ing by available firepower or soft-kill capabil- ities. While a range of sensors from imagery to human intelligence may detect a given A2/</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">AD asset, any sensor must meet certain cri- teria to be effective. These criteria are access, capacity, resolution, and persistence.</p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Access <span class="p">equates to a sensor’s effective reach. A high-gain receiver may be able to detect certain signals from hundreds of miles away, while a SOF surveillance</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">team’s range may be limited to line of sight and thermal imager resolution. Given the consequences of being ranged by U.S. fire- power, future enemies are likely to devote significant combat power to counter recon- naissance and destroy American ISR assets. Mines can keep submarines at bay, and aggressive rear area security can neutralize SOF strategic reconnaissance efforts. SAMs might not be the only threat to air-breathing ISR assets. The Russians have designed air- to-air missiles such as the R-37 and R-172 with ranges in excess of 100 nautical miles. These “AWACS killers” could threaten U.S. ISR assets, keeping airborne sensors away from a battlefield and reducing their access. We speak of access as effective reach because range is not the only way to gain access. American ISR assets can also evade enemy counter-reconnaissance by methods such as survivability (operating from a platform that can absorb or evade enemy punishment) and clandestine emplacement (an unseen SOF team or a stealth platform).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><i>Capacity </i>refers to the amount of data a sensor can gather and process. For imagery sensors, this might be expressed in gigapix- els, or square meters. For signals efforts, the number of channels monitored might be a relevant metric. Capacity is critical because of the familiar “empty battlefield” effect brought on by increasing weapon lethality. Between World War I and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, battlefield density decreased by a factor of 16.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61"> </span>Historian Trevor Dupuy mea- sured 40,000 meters of battlefield per soldier in the latter conflict. This trend will likely continue in A2/AD conflicts. Longer range IADS and tactical missiles can attack from far off, thereby defeating U.S. ISR access in a linear fashion—weapons push away from a sensor kilometer by kilometer. Range is even harsher in its effect on capacity, however.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As a weapon’s effective range doubles (as the SA-17 doubled the range of the legacy</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">SA-6 SAM), its potential hiding space on the battlefield quadruples. This fact might drive the United States to adopt ISR assets that can rapidly collect over a large area (whether geographic or electromagnetic).</p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Resolution <span class="p">refers to the ability to dis- tinguish target signature from background noise. Research into HVI targeting in Iraq and Afghanistan found three critical ele- ments of resolution: identity, geospatial, and temporal. </span>Identity <span class="p">resolution shows what</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a target is—a church versus a barracks, a civilian versus an enemy agent. For fixed sites, identity resolution may be sufficient  for targeting since imagery methods of geo- location are well refined and facilities do not change rapidly. For a runway, it is probably sufficient to see if it is still present a few days before a missile strike. Mobile targets such as HVIs and TELARs need good geospatial and temporal resolution. <i>Geospatial </i>resolution tells exactly where a target is (in a particular county or at a particular street corner). <i>Temporal </i>resolution lets us know when the other two attributes have been detected.  This could be hours or minutes ago. Closer  is better, of course, but weapon capabilities and dynamic targeting procedures would determine specifically how accurate ISR resolution must be.</p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Persistence <span class="p">refers to the length of time a sensor can collect data. Sensors with high persistence can access the battlefield for a long time. If a sensor was fast and had an infinite </span>capacity <span class="p">(that is, it could collect on the entire battlefield at once) and exquisite resolution, it would not need persistence— all relevant HVTs would become visible</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">at a scan of the sensor. Of course, no such sensor exists, and current systems need to invest time scanning the battlefield either searching for a particular HVT or stalking an existing one, waiting for its signature to change. In the stalk mode, a signals intel- ligence aircraft can wait for an enemy radio net to activate or a UAS can wait for an HVI to depart a safe house, opening the opportu- nity for a strike.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">We have already shown that key A2/ AD threats (such as mobile SAMs and SSMs) possess both low signature and high mobil- ity. Finding a static, nonemitting TEL on a battlefield is a tall order. Missile launch may give sensors better detection odds, but ISR’s goals should be predictive (or “left of the plume”), not a forensic examination of a suc- cessful enemy attack.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Effective search is the toughest problem facing intelligence support to the JOAC. Its success is tied to precious sensors that must effectively balance multiple dimensions. Search must be coordinated</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">with (and occasionally compete against) other military activities, and their ISR platforms must survive enemy efforts to thwart sensor access by destruction, denial, or deception. Still, effective search is not sufficient for intelligence success; actionable fusion must take place to ensure collected intelligence delivers value to an end user— usually a commander or a shooter—who is responsible for delivering firepower via land, sea, air, or cyber platform.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In existing intelligence doctrine, col- lection ostensibly delivers lists of answers  to questions written in the form of priority intelligence requirements. Commanders allegedly write these requirements and then consume and synthesize collected intel- ligence to make decisions regarding the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">course of the battle. In actuality, intelligence staff officers usually write up requirements,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the application of lethal fires. To the greatest extent possible, its elements should not be simulated, and national agencies expected  to support an intelligence effort during war should be present in training. Likewise, the analysis and PED feeding actionable fusion should not be a pickup game of individual augmentees and hastily assigned reachback analysts. Commanders and intelligence professionals should work out the people, processes, and technology beforehand given what we know about past experience and potential future combat scenarios.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Implications</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As we evolve the operational access concept in response to A2/AD threats, we need to size the force to ensure that the Armed Forces and combat support agen- cies have the proper tools in the numbers</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and PED support to JTFs can be wildly off the mark. Operation <i>Iraqi Freedom </i>began in 2003 and was supported mainly by Air Force Predator UASs that were augmented by a handful of short endurance, low-resolution UASs operated by the Army. By 2008, the UAS presence on the battlefield had grown by a factor of 25.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61"> </span>Human intelligence (HUMINT) capabilities expanded rapidly as well. At the start of <i>Iraqi Freedom</i>, brigades fielded one small HUMINT team each. By 2008, it was not uncommon for battalions to have two teams apiece, sourced both from the brigade’s organic military intelligence company and augmentees from general support military intelligence or battlefield surveillance brigades. At the Army’s intel- ligence center at Fort Huachuca, Arizona,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a forest of buildings rose from the desert to train newly minted HUMINT specialists.

A common</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">explanation for this disconnect was that</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">which are often not synchronized with adjacent echelons. Additionally, shooters are likely to be even more voracious consumers of intelligence than their commanders. They are more numerous, of course, and hold the responsibility to actually execute the com- mander’s plan by fighting and defeating the enemy. The intelligence that these shooters need may be highly perishable—a ballistic missile TEL may be set up for less than 30 minutes before it shoots from a presurveyed location. Aggressive time selection standards will demand fast actionable fusion that aids the shooter in finding and killing its target. The end result of actionable fusion is not a detailed briefing. It is a smoking crater.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In this scenario, intelligence analysts and the processing, exploitation, and dis- semination infrastructure must work relent- lessly on reducing the sensor-shooter link</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to meet tough dynamic targeting standards. Actionable fusion requires deliberate place- ment of each communications link, storage system, dissemination path, and approval mechanism that touches collected data. In an A2/AD scenario, the JTF intelligence function can neither pass erroneous infor- mation to a shooter nor let a fleeting target slip through the cracks. Intelligence support to time-sensitive targeting must be a battle drill practiced as rigorously and regularly as</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">needed to defeat these threats. As we have seen, the ISR stakes are high in any A2/AD scenario due to the speed at which an enemy can deliver firepower and the vulnerable concentrations (for example, ships, airfields, and forward operating bases) U.S. forces will present on the battlefield. For combat units and logistics, there is a great deal of back- ground to assist in force-sizing. A mecha- nized infantry battalion can nominally cover four kilometers of frontage in the defense, and fighter wings and carrier groups can hit a certain number of targets per day depend- ing on distance, munitions, and tankers available. The logistics community can plan using consumption rates for fuel, food, and munitions under certain circumstances. Even if these planning factors are somewhat off the mark, they give a solid starting point for planners thinking about future forces. Sizing ISR is more problematic. The Intelli- gence Community has fewer rules of thumb, and much systemic intelligence data are classified and hard to access. ISR application is not formulaic; 25 gallons of diesel may fill up a Humvee, and 18 standard pallets may fit on a C-17, but there is no equivalent solu- tion that <i>x </i>number of ISR hours will detect an SSM in a wooded environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The result of poor forecasting tech- niques and a dearth of hard data is that ISR</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. land forces had prepared to fight a mechanized foe that was easy to find but hard to kill. In Iraq (and Afghanistan), these forces instead faced an irregular threat of insurgents who were unable to hold ground against overwhelming American firepower, yet they were devilishly difficult to find.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ISR capabilities present at the outset of Operation <i>Iraqi Freedom </i>were largely determined by two methods: subject matter expert (SME) assessment, where a group of experienced professionals gives its experi-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">enced opinion on matters, and modeling and simulations (M&amp;S), a largely computerized process of wargaming possible scenarios. Both have their place as assessment tools. SMEs can deliver answers quickly and leverage large amounts of personal experi- ence. M&amp;S can deliver detailed answers to concrete questions, such as the outcome</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of battles between mechanized units. Both have shortcomings when applied to ISR force-sizing.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">SME input is critical to any assessment. As a standalone capability, subject matter expert results are quick and usually trusted. Very good M&amp;S include input and valida- tion from SMEs, particularly when exact measurements of a modeled attribute are</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">not available. Another sizing method called operations assessment also requires either</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">SME input or direct observation to build understanding and gain expertise. However, SMEs are not perfect. For instance, they are highly subjective to “success story” bias. When interviewed, operators and intel- ligence professionals tend to amplify the importance of a given ISR or PED capability if they have seen it succeed once or have viewed a success story vignette, often on a PowerPoint slide. These vignettes may not be representative of an ISR asset’s performance, but because they often create a compelling narrative, they can be powerful platforms</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to drive the adoption and proliferation of certain capabilities. Additionally, context matters. Two brigade commanders inter- viewed regarding their tenures in Afghani- stan gave different answers when asked to gauge the effectiveness of ground moving target indicator (GMTI) support. Success bias might affect these differences, as might incompetent (or particularly skilled) intel- ligence analysts. Finally, one unit could have gotten better results because its terrain is better suited for GMTI collection. None of these factors automatically invalidates SME input, but they demonstrate that it may not stand alone without follow-on analysis.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">M&amp;S are often touted as good capabili- ties to show future performance because they can be predictive. Indeed, when one has a great deal of data on a discrete situation  (so many friendly tanks, so many rounds</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of ammunition, and so many opposition tanks), M&amp;S can deliver some good answers. Unfortunately, ISR does not often present convenient factors such as coverage areas</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">or consumption rates. Signal propagation rates may vary significantly depending on time of day, antenna placement, and aircraft altitude. Factors such as zoom and altitude also affect full-motion video area and reso- lution. Skill and experience are significant drivers of a sensor operator’s ability to track a given target. Simulating such an environ- ment relies on serial assumptions that dra- matically reduce the chances of producing valid results. On the PED side, matters are even worse. M&amp;S cannot hope to replicate factors that drive successful targeting, such as complex intelligence reporting (much of which is narrative) or the variance in quality among intelligence analysts. If one does attempt to account for these variances, inac- curacies can compound, skewing the results. As one study noted, applying M&amp;S to intelli- gence employment is inherently challenging</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">“because the generated results are often built on multiple nested and tenuous assumptions and approximations.”<span class="s60">6</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Operations Assessment</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">For sizing ISR in support of the JOAC, an operations research technique known as operations assessment will likely outper- form SME- or M&amp;S-driven approaches. If appropriately employed alongside traditional sizing methods, it may yield results that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">are “less wrong” in the highly ambiguous world of forecasting ISR needs. Operations assessments start with developing a deep understanding of a unit’s wartime mission and the operation of the ISR and PED assets that usually support them. SME input or direct observation is therefore important</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">in the first stage of operations assessment, but rather than using this input as an end- point for a staff briefing or position paper, operations assessments treat SME input</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as hypotheses to be tested with systemic data. This methodology proved successful in determining the key elements of HVI hunting in Iraq and Afghanistan and, later, the best way to kill indirect fire teams in Sadr City. In 2007, the Office of the Secre- tary of Defense hired a group of consultants to measure the performance of ISR and PED in supporting specific missions by examin- ing key mission drivers (often determined</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">through SME interviews and input) and sub- stantial quantitative analysis. By reviewing thousands of storyboards, significant activi- ties, intelligence reports, and sensor data records, the assessment team determined key drivers of success that led to several force-sizing decisions.<span class="s60">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Of course, while we have terabytes of operations and intelligence data from Iraq and Afghanistan, we are not currently fight- ing any countries that pose A2/AD threats. This does not invalidate the operations assessment approach, however. Certain elements of information will generalize. Some intelligence activities go on year round whether we are at war or peace. Mea- surement of those activities in peacetime, and the performance of key PED and ISR systems, could give insight into how they would perform in a shooting war against</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">an enemy trying to destroy or spoof U.S. sensors. We do not know the performance of every IADS in the world, but we do have recent knowledge of how Libyan IADS</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reacted to U.S. forces and how successful our</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">attacks, assessments, and followup strikes were.

Gray is Professor of International Politics and Strategic Studies at the University of Reading, United Kingdom. This article is an adaptation of chapter six in his most recent book, <i>Perspectives on Strategy </i>(Oxford University Press, 2013).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s152" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 61pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">he world is awash with political and strategic advice purport- ing to be remedies for current and anticipated ills. Rather</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">less abundant are works that seek to render thought about strategic problems more robust. To that end, I examine strategic phe- nomena from five perspectives, each of which is seriously undertheorized for the explana- tion necessary as a basis for understanding. My chosen five are concepts, ethics, culture, geography, and technology. Despite the familiar character of these perspectives and their intrinsic significances, comprehension</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of their meanings for strategy in general and for their relative importance in particular historical cases is seriously weak. Lawrence sees a whole house of war, which I adapt as a whole house of strategy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">It is ironic, not paradoxical, to argue for a holistic understanding of strategy and to lay emphasis upon a general theory whose tenets unite the field, while also emphasizing the need to explore the single subject of strategy from different perspectives. The contradic- tion between unity and division is only apparent because it is the robust inclusivity</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the general theory of strategy that enables</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">particular perspectives to be explored safely. When the general theory is regarded properly as being conceptually sovereign, the danger  is greatly reduced that strategic practice</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">will be in thrall to some reductionist views (for example, strategy regarded as applied intellect, morality, culture, geography, or technology). It is only possible to allow the distinctive perspectives on the whole house of strategy their due when that edifice is stand- ing whole and well constructed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">There is no correct number of perspec- tives in which strategy can be viewed. As a social scientist, I am intellectually comfort- able with a subject that does not yield to research and analysis in quest of a Higgs boson–like most fundamental particle of truth. As a fairly devout Clausewitzian, I would like to claim that politics is the God particle for strategy, but such an assertion could not be entirely satisfactory. When</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">one starts down the path of fundamental enquiry into causality, there, is unlikely to  be a happy epiphany because the journey can have no attainable end. Behind and fueling politics is human nature, but a nature that probably requires contextual placement to  be translatable for a meaningful perspective on strategy. For illustration, it can be diffi- cult to come to grips analytically with moral and other authority. As context always itself must have context, so moral authority can only derive in its turn from yet higher moral authority, and so on, rather unhelpfully for useful understanding.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Unlike strategy’s general theory, which should by definition be complete, if ever unfinished, perspectives on strategy can always be augmented or reduced according to intellectual taste and fashion concerning desirable inclusivity and exclusivity. Schol- arly mission creep is an enduring danger. To explain, studies of World War II respectively in conceptual, moral, cultural, geographical, or technological perspective may slip the leash of conceptual and empirical discipline and “go native” by producing a moral, or cul- tural history of the war. The partial perspec- tive intentionally privileged from the outset is, in effect, hard to prevent from swallowing the rest. This is a familiar malady.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In his command performance, the strategist strives to cope well enough with multilayered complexity. Each perspective always is in play and has some relevance. This can be frustrating to the scholar who unwisely seeks a measure of certain under-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">standing that history, let alone contempo- rary or future contexts, cannot provide, no matter how elegant the equations or how powerful the data analyzing machines may be. Notwithstanding claims to the contrary, it is not accurate to conceive of strategic studies as a scholarly discipline. Particu- larly unhelpful are efforts to maintain the “stovepipes” of alleged purity for historical, social scientific, or hard physical scientific methodologies. Social science without history can be likened to driving in the dark without a rear-view mirror to reveal whence you have come and what is behind you (and may well still be with you).<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61"> </span>History with little or no social science worthy of the name is likely to teeter on the brink of explanation that under-reaches in the meaning to events it can supply. Indeed, so powerfully can the contextuality of history impose a respect for (yesterday’s) presentism that the historian</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is likely to be unable to answer, if he even understands, the social scientific strategist’s question, “So what?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Theory of Strategy: Coping with Complexity</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">While the general theory of strategy educates about the permanent structure and functioning of the whole of its subject, it aspires to achieve no more than that. The theory educates its students to help enable</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">them to cope with the specific strategic chal- lenges of their day. There is need to capture two realities: that of a united subject, but also that of a subject manifesting itself in ever-changing forms. The architectural endurance of the whole house of strategy might mislead the unwary into believing that the weight of relative influence of the perspectives either is permanent or is equal among them all. In historical practice, every perspective yields a contributing subnarra- tive to the gestalt that is the grand narrative of strategy. But those subnarratives, confus- ingly interdependent though they are, reveal a course of events and suggest an explana- tion wherein some factors would seem to carry more weight than others.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Whereas, on the one hand, strategy is difficult to do well enough because of the complexity of its domain, on the other hand, that complexity provides options to help work around problems. The challenge to clarity of understanding posed by the com- plexity of the whole house of strategy is easily illustrated. Wherever one looks in strategic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">history, the competition for pole position as most significant perspective is apt to be intense; if it is not, the reason probably is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">because scholars have not examined the case in sufficient width, depth, and context.<span class="s60">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">For any strategic historical case, there will be human decisionmakers behaving with variable discretion in a context of political, bureaucratic, cultural, moral,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and other contexts. Histories that favor the conceptual, the ethical, or the geographical perspective, inter alia, can hardly help but give an unbalanced interpretation of events. Yet each perspective is in some measure true. The general theory of strategy should be able to advise on what to look for, but it can never be mobilized itself to explain how the perspectives it accommodates should</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">be rank-ordered for their relative potency. Geography (distance, terrain, weather) usually explains a lot, but the specific reasons why it is relevant to historical strate- gies have to be sought in human personality, circumstance, and beliefs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The attractions of monocausality (“strategy is really all about . . .”) are as obvious and substantial as they are lethal to balanced understanding. Nonetheless, the scholar would be well advised not to be so tolerant in his recognition of complex- ity and multicausality that meaningful explanation is impossible. One can adapt Gresham’s Law—that bad money tends to drive out good—to read that a prolifera- tion of strategic explanations with lower value tends to obscure and diminish the worth attached to explanations with higher value. Although all coins in circulation</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">have some value, the fact that those of lower worth circulate more rapidly—Gresham’s point—should not be allowed to obscure the intrinsic worth of higher denomination coins. To convert this illustration: although strategic history is a drama played by a cast</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">comprising the subjects of every perspective, however organized conceptually by category, at most times, in most places, and in most circumstances, some perspectives, perhaps just one or two such, can plausibly be judged dominant (for example, the political spirit is willing, the purpose is morally imperative, but alas the helicopters cannot fly in fog).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The strategic theorist can be thought of as a maker of conceptual tools for the practicing strategist. In his harrowing moral memoir of his combat tour in Vietnam as a young Marine officer, Karl Marlantes offers</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the thought that “Weapons are tools. Tools are an extension of ourselves. Tools make you more effective. They are ego enhancing. Ask any good carpenter how he feels about a really good tool. We enhance our feelings of self-worth if we have good tools.”<span class="s60">3</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">When strategic theorists discuss the relationship in strategic history between mind and muscle, brain and brawn, they are apt to commit the same kind of error as do politicians and soldiers, though from a different point of view. Of course, there is an objective empirical difference between thought and behavior. But in historical reality this seemingly unambiguous dis- tinction is blurred. Behavior is thought in action. Not all concepts are converted into action and applied in strategic performance in the field, but it is a fair generalization to claim that there has to be some fusion of thought and deed. Orders and commands may be obviously exterior to the directed behavior, but there is a sense in which, once committed to action, the military instru- ment will have internalized the relevant part of the conceptual contribution to fighting power. The soldiers commanded will attempt to play out the roles that the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">conceptual script demands, while the troops’ armament and elements of supporting infrastructure reflect and express recent conceptual preferences. The distinction between the theory and practice of strategy is both objective and subjective; it is real, yet it is also artificial. The mind and its concep- tual constructions are not set aside, parked for the duration, when soldiers go to war</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">or when inert materials are converted and assembled into weapons.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The essential unity in the apparent duality that is strategic thought and strategic practice is a major source of misunderstand- ing and confusion in strategic studies, but so is what one can identify as the yearning for ever-more fundamental truth. By analogy, the God particle malady lurks close to my argument. The laudable desire to penetrate ever deeper into the complex mystery that is strategy has the unfortunate and undeserved consequence of fueling scholars in a futile quest. Expeditionary efforts to discover the true source of the metaphorical Nile for strategy divert endeavors from grasping</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">that which is attainable and is both good enough for its purpose and incapable of major improvement. In truth, the source of the Nile for the understanding of strategy</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">already exists and is readily accessible in the canon of strategic classics written over the course of two and a half millennia.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As well as the hope that the specifica- tion and testing of assumptions will serve a panacea filtering duty, a reductionist urge can seduce scholars and commentators into the error of the big game hunt for the factor that could be the prime mover of strategic phenomena. Among its many virtues, the general theory of strategy serves to discour- age monocausal explanation. For example, while there is support in the theory for the claim that strategy must be technological, in plentiful addition the theory asserts that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">strategy is political, human, ethical, and geo- graphical, inter alia. But because strategy is so complex in its working parts, and causes and effects are inherently so problematic, there is always some empirical basis upon which an overreaching partial theory can rest. It is a prime duty of strategic education to explain the enduring structure and functioning of strategy so that the limitations of partial theory are identified. Just as there is no single master cause of war that might be expunged from history as a result of dedicated assault, though politics and human nature (or human behavior in society) would be prime candi- dates were causal cleansing practicable, so also there is no golden key to the understand- ing of strategy in theory and for practice.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Because the strategist always must attend to the balancing of political ends with available means, orchestrated in appropriate ways, there is a simple essential structure to any strategic project. On the one hand, the subject is formidably complex and encom- passes a cast of thousands that can prevent success. But on the other hand, there is an elegant simplicity to the triadic structure</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of the strategy function that almost begs for duty in service of effective practical performance. Strategic tasks exist at every</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">level of human effort, from grand strategy or national security, to a small-scale operation by a company of soldiers. Ends, ways, and means—and assumptions also, notwith- standing the skeptical comments offered above in their regard—are as unarguably different in meaning from each other as they are interdependent. Historical contextual detail is known to contemporaries as it may be to later scholars, in as much fine granular detail as they need or are able to discover. But in principle at least, the elegant simplic- ity of the ends, ways, and means trinitarian</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">formula provides so potent an organizing concept that the complexity, confusion, and even the chaos of messy interdependent behaviors and events are manageable. The competent strategist copes with complexity, confusion, and impending chaos; he does not seek the fool’s goal of a winning formula that rests upon a severely reductionist priori- tization of what matters more, and less.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Five Perspectives on Strategy</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Each perspective exploited here—con- cepts, ethics, culture, geography, and tech- nology—encourages predatory theorizing  by its scholar-advocates. Each has misled some scholarly devotees into asserting that  it either does, could, or should provide the master narrative. By this I mean that strate- gic history is purported to be really the story of concepts and theory, or morality and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">its ethics, or culture, or geography and its geopolitics and geostrategy, or of technology (pick one, or possibly two). It is my convic- tion that if there is a master narrative to stra- tegic history, it is to be found in the ceaseless quest for power by human beings both individually and socially regarded. Power is sought as a value in and of itself, as well as for its instrumental worth in aid of interests that are ever open to subjective evaluation</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as being defensive or offensive, though they usually are both. The relations of relative power, known as politics generically, are eternal and universal because they derive from the biology of our speciation and the sociology of our survival. Humans cooper- ate, combine, and compete for security that has survival value as well as more limited benefit. The master narrative is strategy itself and the politics that fuel it in all its complexity and with all its variability in character over time and in different places.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Concepts. <span class="p">Strategy cannot be under- stood and explained satisfactorily strictly with reference to ideas. Strategic theory and its expressive concepts are necessary but not sufficient ingredients in the mix that is strategy. Mind is superior to human muscle and to the inert material of military tools, but exceptions great and small are fueled mightily by material referents to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">perceptions and considerations, as well as by circumstances and memories. In addition, no matter its absolute or relative potency, the mind and its concepts may need muscular and other material enablers if they are to affect behavior. How a weapon is employed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is more significant than the weapon’s tech- nical characteristics, but this claim has a significant potential to mislead. Superior concepts carry no guarantee of strategic success in the deeply ironic realm of strategy (unless, that is, one succumbs, innocently of course, to unintended tautology). Excellence in concepts is always decided in practice by  a host of factors, most importantly including their situational relevance. Also, strategic history reveals that the strategic intellect has often fallen perilously far behind emerg-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ing material technical realities. The case of cyberpower today and the pressing need for its strategic comprehension is but the latest example of conceptual lag.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ethics<span class="s49">. </span><span class="p">The ethical perspective on strat- egy is unarguably essential; what is more, it</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="458" height="246" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_095.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Army (Ken Scar)</p><p class="s36" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Deputy commanding general for maneuver discusses strategy for Operation <i>Shamshir </i>in the Mata Khan District with U.S. Soldiers, Afghan National Army soldiers, and members of local Afghan Uniformed Police</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is unavoidable for human beings. The reason this is so is because we humans appear to be hard-wired to think in moral terms. It is a survival necessity for our species to reason morally. We need to distinguish right from wrong, and permitted from forbidden behav- ior. So far so good, since it would seem that moral reasoning, applied in ethical codes,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is inherent in our humanity. Unfortunately, two major factors complicate the picture. First, one needs to recognize that just because all people, except for deviant and dysfunctional individuals, think morally, it does not follow that they think morally in the same way. In other words, while it matters profoundly that my neighbors should have a clear sense of right and wrong, what matters no less strongly is the content of their moral beliefs. What do they believe to be right-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ful action? Culture rules over, transcends, and becomes ethics. The problem for the strategist is not an enemy who eccentrically is amoral, but rather one who is licensed</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in his behavior by an ethical code that expresses moral beliefs I reject. Second, it is a universal and apparently eternal truth that strategic ethics are always more or less situ- ationally determined, notwithstanding the sincerity of the moral beliefs they typically reflect. Morality in action as strategic ethics frequently accepts the perceived necessity</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of circumstances as an excuse for what otherwise must be categorized as wrongful behavior. Moral beliefs always need transla- tion into an ethical code for applicability in the unforgiving world of perceived and often misperceived (expedient) necessity.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Culture. <span class="p">Is there an American, Russian, Chinese, inter alia, way of war, or way in</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">strategy? Perhaps a shift from the singular to the plural is more appropriate, as also is serious entertainment of the idea that ways in war and strategy may change over time. If one is willing to grant the proposition that because a polity’s military instrument is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">certain to be diverse in its complex character, it has to follow that it is likely to harbor a range of preferred “ways.” The more closely one examines the idea of culture, and the more nuanced one’s appreciation of its</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">ever-arguable complex domain, the more difficult it can be to find forensic merit in it as an aid to strategic understanding, let</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">alone as a valuable predictive tool. However, not only does culture inspire and sometimes demand an influence upon behavior, but inconveniently for analytical discipline there is culture in, as well as on, behavior. Cultur- ally fueled action itself can beget culture in many forms. Is there not a sense in which all strategic behavior simply has to be cultur- ally expressive? After all, such behavior is performed by necessarily and unavoidably encultured people who are shaped in their thoughts and deeds by the interests of the organizations they represent, interests expressed in some cultural forms. The chal- lenge is neither to find the lacunae in cultur- alist arguments, nor to seek to refute anticul- turalist assault. By and large, those necessary tasks have been completed. The mission now is to save what is sensible in the arguments for cultural awareness about strategy from the claims in its praise that were excessive. Sensibly understood, culture is not the sin- gular golden key to strategic understanding, but it can nonetheless provide vital clues</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and cues that have practical value. Culture</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">is inescapable from Man’s estate, and encul-</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">turation is always somewhat local in content to time, place, and as a consequence identity, much of which is socially inherited.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Geography<span class="s49">. </span><span class="p">As culture is perilously imperial for strategic understanding in its elusive ethereality, so geography menaces conceptual grip for reason of its physical ubiquity. While much if not all that matters for strategy has some often arguably cultural content, there is no room for dispute over the presence of the geographical wherever strat- egy is thought or done. The unique geophysi- cal properties of each of the five geographical domains of strategy—land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace—dominate tactical feasibility and hence operational and strategic opportu- nity for political gain and loss. The physical stage for the long-running drama of strategic history is indifferent to human strategic endeavors. Geography is neutral in human strategic history, but it is liable to be influen- tial as security communities seek to exploit or offset geographically defined opportuni- ties and limitations. Strategy must always be done within a geography, while often essen- tially it is about geography. And geography</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is not only a physical matter of the natural realm. In addition, the geography coveted most is deemed sacred and is uniquely valued by a political community (or two such). The challenge is less to recognize the relevance</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of geography to strategy than to be able to restrict its allotted scope for influence to some prudent distance short of the exciting assertion that geography is destiny. This claim has merit, but considered in isolation it falls a long way short of providing the whole grand narrative of strategic history.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Geography, geopolitics, and geostrategy have been imprudently neglected by students of strategy for more than half a century.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Technology. <span class="p">Strategy is not about tech- nology, though much of the popular media effort to exploit the largely male fascination with machines focuses on the military means in the strategy triad. As a consequence, one might be excused for the belief that technol- ogy’s artifacts lie at the core of strategy. Whereas the moral impulses behind ethics and the values expressed in culture them- selves yield motives that in political form serve as the ends of strategy, concepts and technology are strictly enablers of strategic achievement; as tools disconnected from their strategic and political purposes, they have no merit. Neither strategic ideas nor weapon systems are discovered or manufac- tured in order to be attractive to the intellect or to the emotions as ends in themselves. Particular intellectual and technical forms are preferred for the anticipated excellence</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of their fit as enablers for the realization of strategic and military intentions. The argu- ment that we fight with, and not for, technol- ogy engineered as weapons is so obvious as to be banal. And yet the whole political and societal effort to invent, pay for, produce, improve, and use with doctrinal best practice weapons and their supporting systems is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">so consuming of attention that the political ends and strategic ways often disappear from view. Money and physicality attract public attention. Weapons in action, photogenically often in motion at least, can be understood tactically, as can their monetary cost; hence they attract notice and controversy. Means are easier to grasp and debate than are strategic ways and political purposes. One might recall with advantage these immortal cognate words by Michael Howard: “the complex problem of running an army at all  is liable to occupy his [the commander’s] mind so completely that it is very easy to forget what it is being run <i>for</i>.”<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61"> </span>Expertise in tactical matters necessarily confers no like grasp of genuinely strategic concerns, but such expertise is essential if the strategist</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is to comprehend what his military instru- ment might be able to accomplish. Although strategy is ever superordinate in providing meaning for behavior, it has to be done by tactics. When understanding of strategy is not grasped in the round as presented in the general theory, its particular military instru- ments, ranging from special operations</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">forces, through long-range bomber fleets, to individually super-destructive weapons,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">commonly are confused with—they are mis- taken for—strategy. This prime conceptual error of miscategorization is found most frequently in the mistaken belief that there are some inherently strategic weapons, while other weapons allegedly are substrategic or nonstrategic.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Strategy is a project that is always practiced in particular times and places. Whatever historical examples of strategy one elects to consider, they had temporal prov- enance and consequences as legacy value from past experience. The study and practice of strategy have to deal with continuity and change as well as causes and consequences. The future is not foreseeable, but a historical perspective ensures that the great chain of contestable historical causation should at least be noticed and respected, even though it could not have been predicted in real time, which is to say in advance. The ever-imper- fect wisdom of hindsight serves as a source of caveats potent for contemporary strategic practitioners, who may be seduced by the apparent novelty of current challenges into forgetting that the chain of cause and effects (for example, first, second, and third order) is likely to be neither reliably predictable nor even seriously capable of anticipation. The practicing strategist is a risk taker of varying courage, wisdom, and luck who throws metaphorical dice. Clausewitz went to some pains to make this claim. Strategic education has been ill-served by paucity of coopera- tion between the somewhat rival “stovepipe” professionalisms of military history and strategic studies. Tribal members of the latter persuasion incline professionally to take a negative view of “mere” historical nar- rative, while members of the former readily wax eloquent on the subject of strategists with an empirical historical knowledge so thin that their theorization inherently must be suspect. The social scientist as strategist frequently finds professional historian col- leagues to be methodologically challenged, specifically in their apparent neglect of the “so what?” question. Some historians are suspicious of social scientists who have been known to engage in professional poach-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ing on their tribal terrain. Admittedly, the integrity of the past can be violated by later scholars who have cases to make that far transcend unimpeachable evidence. But since the facts of the past tend to be silent</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">unless they are explained, which means theorized, it is not obvious that the historian and social scientist must differ for reason of their preferred methodologies. I believe that social scientific strategists should be deeply respectful of the past, which means to the stories told by historians that collectively are termed history. In addition, indeed in paral- lel, I believe that historian-strategists need all possible assistance in seeking under- standing for plausible explanations they can extract from the writings of their strate-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">gist colleagues who are social scientists. Adoption of the elementary, but elemental, triptych of ends, ways, and means as a guide for strategic historical enquiry would be a useful step toward some enlightening fusion of scholarly realms.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Although strategy can be examined in many perspectives, nonetheless it is a unity. When examined closely, each perspective</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is revealed both to be identifiably distinc- tive, yet porous to influence from other perspectives. It has to follow that the subject of strategy cannot sensibly be regarded as offering alternative flavors in substantive interpretation. It is not sound to conceive of strategy as being essentially, or even primar- ily, a conceptual, moral, cultural, geographi- cal, or technological project (inter alia); it</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is all of these combined, even fused, albeit in combinations with historically widely varying relative weights. Strategy is a single enterprise. Theory and practice have to be considered as one whole project, not merely as joint ventures that episodically are linked in a relationship of some interdependence; the nexus is far more organic than that. The</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="220" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_096.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">unity of all strategic phenomena is expressed effectively in strategy’s general theory. That theory provides the big tent of understand- ing that shelters and indeed binds together the whole subject. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">N O T e S</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l24"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">I am grateful to Richard Danzig for the inspired wording of the title to his monograph, <i>Driving in the Dark: Ten Propositions About Pre- diction and National Security </i>(Washington, DC: Center for a New American Security, October 2011).</p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">Michael Howard, <i>The Causes of Wars and Other Essays </i>(London: Counterpoint, 1983), 215–217.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">Karl Marlantes, <i>What It Is Like to Go to War</i></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(London: Corvus, 2011), 71.</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">Howard, 214, emphasis in the original.</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="807" height="1045" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_097.png"/></span></p><p class="s144" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DOD (Lacordrick Wilson)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s153" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 28pt;line-height: 27pt;text-align: left;">Globally <span class="s145">Integrated</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s154" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 31pt;text-align: left;">A Reflection of Environmental</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: right;">Computer screens reflect on Sailor aboard USS <i>San Antonio </i>during International Mine Countermeasures Exercise in Bahrain</p><p class="s145" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 27pt;text-align: left;">Operations</p><p class="s154" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 28pt;text-align: left;">Complexity</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s155" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By <b>d A n i e l  H .

Unfortunately, that is the case with current Department of Defense (DOD) organizational structures and processes, which are basically anachronisms left over from the Cold War. Today, resources are</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">too few, the world too complex, and the environment too unstable to maintain such an outdated structure. This article proposes that DOD must reorganize itself so that its processes and actions are more responsive to today’s requirements and future global demands. Any organizational design must acknowledge that DOD cannot operate as it has for the past half century as global archi- tects attempting to control events as they unfold. Instead, it must move to a design that focuses on resiliency and the manage- ment of global events.<span class="s60">3</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">To understand organizational design requirements for a 21<span class="s60">s</span><span class="s61">t</span>-century joint force, the role of organizational design is discussed first in this essay.

The dynamics of the interaction between mission and environment are the shaping mechanisms that ultimately define an organization’s structure and the degree to which it is formal or informal, centralized or decentralized, flat or vertical, permanent or ad hoc, or some combination thereof.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">There are two dimensions to any orga- nizational design: structural and contextual. The structural dimension is the more visible and typically far more prominent, providing the “labels that describe the internal charac- teristics of the organization.”<span class="s60">6</span><span class="s61"> </span>It is concerned with “the ways in which the tasks of the organization are divided (differentiation) and with the coordination of these activities (integration). . . .

In centralized organiza- tions, decisions tend to be made at the top; in decentralized organizations, lower levels make similar decisions. As organizations grow larger and involve more personnel, the sheer number of decisions required would overwhelm senior leaders if some delegation did not occur. Thus, larger organizations permit greater decentralization. To ensure consistency, however, “larger organizations adopt more formal procedures to improve control” because direct “personal control becomes problematic as size increases.”<span class="s60">9</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In smaller units, every decision effectively can involve the commander and thus these</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">organizations are typically highly central- ized. With smaller size, however, comes less formalization and the ability to react and adapt more quickly because of a flatter orga- nizational structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Unfortunately, an organization only defined by its hard wiring represents an impoverished view of design because it ignores the contextual dimensions, or “soft wiring.” Contextual dimensions are “the  less visible aspects that play a crucial role in determining organizational behavior and performance.”<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">0 </span>The whole organization and surrounding environment display charac- teristics of the contextual dimensions.

An organiza- tion’s design directly affects personal perfor- mance in three main ways: it can motivate behavior through job definition and the use of rewards systems; it can facilitate behavior by providing methods and procedures and by placing personnel proximally to others  for communication; and it can constrain behavior by limiting information, instituting formal procedures, and through the separa- tion of groups or units from one another.<span class="s60">12</span><span class="s61"> </span>A consciously integrated organizational design thus considers both the hard and soft wiring of an organization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Strategic environment</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The organizational environment consists of those elements outside the boundaries of the organization to which it is sensitive and responsive.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">3 </span>Those outside elements include technological, economic, legal, political, demographic, ecological, and cultural factors and are the primary</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">drivers of environmental and organizational change. A comprehensive understanding of the strategic environment helps determine organizational structure(s) and, along with  a keen understanding of the organization’s mission, enable the development of a more focused set of factors that makes these broad environmental variables more relevant.<span class="s60">14</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Globalization has made the strategic environment essentially an open system.

In the CCJO, the Chairman describes the future security environment as “likely to be more unpre- dictable, complex, and potentially more dan- gerous than today.”<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">6 </span>The primary generator of the future security environment is the accelerating rate of change of many of the environmental variables.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The worldwide flow of information and capital through digital networks, along with an equally mobile global popula-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">tion, markedly differentiates the future environment from the past. In this new global environment, the dynamics of these interrelated challenges create complex threats and security challenges. The many dimensions of future security challenges will cross-cut existing boundaries and command structures<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">8 </span>requiring a more highly devel- oped worldview. Some of the future global trends include changing demographics and expectations, globalization, economics and national and international financial insti- tutional health, increased energy demands, food and water scarcity, global population increases, environmental pollution, climate change and natural disasters, and advance- ments in space and cyberspace.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In addition to these global trends, a number of other contextual considerations must be accounted for in the strategic environment. Regional powers and rising global powers such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China present unique challenges for Washington. These countries possess mili- tary capabilities ranging from conventional forces to antiaccess and area-denial capa- bilities to cyberspace operators to nuclear weapons, and they must be accounted for in the development of environmental under- standing. Other factors such as weak and failing states, radical ideologies, transna- tional criminal networks, terrorism, piracy, and urbanization add further complexity and dynamicity to an already dangerous operating environment.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">9 </span>Still other factors that drive organizational redesign are changes in U.S. strategy, new technology,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">changing fiscal constraints, and ineffective organizational operations.<span class="s60">20</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A consolidated understanding of stra- tegic conditions, trends, and other factors provides a comprehensive initial under- standing of the operating environment for the joint force. Prior to developing a joint force organizational structure capable of operating within this environment, however, an analysis of the organization’s mission or anticipated mission sets is needed.<span class="s60">21</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Missions</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The 2010 National Security Strat- egy states that the United States seeks a “world in which individuals enjoy more</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">freedom and opportunity, and nations have incentives to act responsibly, while facing consequences when they do not.”<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">2 </span>From this global vision connecting security and prosperity, the National Military Strategy describes the joint force mission as one that “provides military capability to defend our [n]ation and allies, and to advance a broader peace, security, and prosperity.”<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">3 </span>Linking the global military mission to the strategic environment, senior military leaders char- acterize the future security environment</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as involving “the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the rise of modern</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">competitor nation-states, violent extremism, regional instability, transnational criminal activity, and competition for resources.”<span class="s60">24</span><span class="s61"> </span>These threats have created new and far more dangerous conditions than in the past.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Whereas the joint force previously operated in a relatively stable, state-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">centric environment, the recent diffusion of advanced technology means that small or middleweight militaries and nonstate actors have capabilities that only superpowers once possessed. This proliferation of techno- logically advanced weapons and munitions places the global commons at risk, threaten- ing forces at their points of origin and as they deploy to operational areas.

In this operating concept, “Joint Force elements, globally pos- tured, combine quickly with each other and mission partners to integrate capabilities</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">fluidly across domains, echelons, geographic boundaries, and organizational affilia- tions.”<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">9 </span>In essence, for the joint force to be effective, General Dempsey argues that the DOD organizational construct must reflect environmental complexities. If the environ- ment has a dozen ways to affect an organiza- tion’s performance, the organization needs a dozen ways to respond or counter. As stated in the CCJO, change will be constant and organizations must also be constantly and quickly changeable, leveraging structures and “processes that are easily reconfigured</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and realigned with a constantly changing strategy.”<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">0 </span>To fulfill the mission of defend- ing the Nation and its allies and advancing a broader peace, security, and prosperity, fun- damental changes to DOD’s organizational structure is an absolute necessity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DOD Organizational Design Requirements</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In the development of any DOD orga- nizational design, strategic thinking must be the centerpiece to help identify, respond to, and shape changes in the global environ- ment.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">1 </span>Organizations in uncertain environ-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ments are managed and controlled differently than those in a certain environment regard- ing positions, departments, control processes, and planning and forecasting. Organizations in certain environments seek predictable transitions and integration, desire legacy systems to generate order, seek preventative cures that enhance efficiencies, emphasize deliberateness, and are willing to work through formally recognized institutions.<span class="s60">32</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In uncertain environments, organiza- tions become increasingly sensitive to the environment to recognize threats and oppor- tunities, which enable swifter responses. Sacrificing organizational efficiencies for effectiveness, the organization becomes  more complex to deal with the complexities of the operational environment. In addition, planning and forecasting become even more important as a way to position the organiza- tion for coordinated, speedy responses. As such, uncertain environments value the organizational attributes of speed, flexibility, integration, and innovation, which mean building on and around “people’s abilities</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">rather than limiting them for the convenience of easily recognized roles.”<span class="s60">33</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The current DOD construct has fostered the creation of well-structured, unbending organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, operating in an uncertain environment requires organizations to make their internal and external boundaries more permeable and flexible.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">4 </span>DOD must find the right fit between the external environment and the internal structure. The joint force requires an adaptable, responsive organi- zational structure that accounts for the 10 assigned primary missions and can respond to challenges that span the range from major combat operations; to limited contingency operations; to military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The combatant commands, Services, and Joint Staff all affect the organizational design of the U.S. military. Combatant com- manders are the link between the national strategic level of decisionmaking and the forces that conduct operations. Combatant commanders have the responsibility for planning and executing strategies and plans for their areas of responsibility.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">5 </span>The design focus, however, must not be on the warfight- ing arm solely; it must also consider the roles and functions of the Services and Joint Staff as they relate to the assigned primary mis- sions and the support they provide to the combatant commands. The Services have the responsibility for training, organizing, and equipping Servicemembers, thus providing ready forces to the combatant commanders for the execution of U.S. military strategy.<span class="s60">36</span><span class="s61"> </span>The Joint Staff supports the Chairman in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">his duty of providing military and strategic advice to the President and Secretary of Defense. Integrating annual assessments provided by the Services and combatant com- mands, the Chairman provides independent comprehensive assessments and advice “that cut across missions, domains, functions,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and time” and “inform the development of national security and defense strategy, policy, doctrine, and guidance.”<span class="s60">37</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Given the Chairman’s new operating concept of globally integrated operations, the military will transform from a conven- tionally focused and capital-intensive (for example, costly weapons systems such as the F-35) force to one oriented on small, adapt- able, globally deployable units that require well-trained, experienced counterinsurgency forces and military police.<span class="s60">38</span><span class="s61"> </span>Mirroring the complexities found in the strategic operating environment requires additional special- ized units to operate in the cyber and space</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">domains as well as to prepare for and respond to weapons of mass destruction incidents.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Although maintaining a traditional conventional force capable of deterring and, failing that, defeating a near-peer competi- tor remains a vital necessity, the need for the entire joint force to possess that primary capability is no longer affordable. Instead, the unit of choice for the force will be the team. Teams of specialists within the force</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">must understand and manage complex prob- lems in a fast-changing and highly competi- tive environment. To leverage these smaller units, operational structures must be flatter and incorporate lateral processes to be more</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="697" height="283" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_098.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Air Force (Timothy Chacon)</p><p class="s36" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Joint team of Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen assigned to Kandahar Provincial Reconstruction Team undergo predeployment language and cultural instruction training</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">responsive to immediate tactical consider- ations.

Organizing by function allows the joint force to present a consolidated focal point to allies, partners, and other regional actors and enables sharing of resources  and expertise across geographic lines while promoting standardization. Organizations develop geographical structures as opera- tions span regions of the world and there is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a need to be close to allies and partners (and threats), and to minimize response times and to reduce cost of travel and transportation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">A process structure centers on a complete flow of work ranging from plan initiation to development. Throughout the process, each functional or geographic stakeholder</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">participates in the sequential flow. A product or plan structure focuses on the development of specific or multiple plans from end to end, which often encompasses multiple processes and functions.<span class="s60">40</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Primarily operating in an uncertain global environment, combatant command-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ers fight wars and focus on the present or the near future. The Joint Staff and Services</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">primarily operate in a more certain domestic environment, are future-focused, and are in the business of preparing for war, not fighting it. Thus, the organizational design structures for the Joint Staff, Services, and combatant commands must be reflective of their specific roles and missions as well as the specific environment within which they operate. Any DOD organizational design must account</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">for the stability of certain components as well as the relative instability of dynamic or</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">uncertain components. Each suborganization is designed and managed differently and yet must remain part of the whole.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The change that globally integrated operations represents is essentially a change in strategy—specifically, the ways and means. Changes in strategies have far-reach- ing implications for the entire enterprise, and any institutional changes must address the following components.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Doctrine. <span class="p">Doctrine is traditionally a compilation of “best practices” based on expe- riences and lessons learned.

Doctrine must be transformed to emphasize a broader range of general operating concepts and be consid- ered a type of intellectual “toolkit.”</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Organization. <span class="p">The primary focus is traditionally on the combatant command</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">or the warfighting organization. The DOD enterprise, however, must be part of a holis- tic design that acknowledges and integrates the roles and functions of the Services and military departments, Chairman and Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy, the formal and informal relationships with the Department of State’s Policy and Planning Staff, and the National Security Staff ’s interagency policy committees. The design must also consider congressional committees with direct ties to the national security enterprise.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Training. <span class="p">Exercises and training pro- grams must be “scripted” for globally inte- grated operations. Joint exercises and train- ing cannot be one-dimensional and must mirror the complex, dynamic environment within which the joint force will operate. Joint forces must become accustomed to operating in degraded environments with minimal higher headquarters and senior leadership command and control injections and direction. Scenarios must present a hybrid of challenges that exercises the adapt- ability and agility of leaders and units as they reconcile environmental, mission, and capabilities mismatches. Training programs must encourage creativity and innovation and be accepting of, if not advocates of, failure.</span></p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Materiel. <span class="p">With major combat opera- tions becoming less likely, future develop- ment and acquisition efforts must be special operations– and cyber-focused. DOD bud- geting, acquisition, and procurement pro- cesses must facilitate rapid prototyping and</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">development. Small technological steps must be the norm instead of the traditional effort to hit the technological home run. Materiel must be readily available and easily adaptable to meet dynamic environmental conditions.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Leadership and Education. <span class="p">The Services and joint force must embrace the multicultural, multilingual, and multiper- spective world that composes the strategic environment. Servicemembers must be recruited, trained, educated, and promoted based on their abilities to think beyond narrow ideologies and singular concepts. Leaders must not only possess technologi- cal and tactical skills but also demonstrate strengths in the traditional social sciences, the emerging norms of an information society, and strategic thinking. Educational institutions must emphasize critical, cre- ative, conceptual, and contextual thinking competencies while developing leaders who display comfort with ambiguity and ill- defined objectives. Educational outcomes must stress understanding, intent, multiple contexts, and the idea that there are poten- tially multiple acceptable solutions to any problem. Institutions must deemphasize a product-focused, easily measured, checklist- oriented training mentality.</span></p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Personnel. <span class="p">Today’s organizations need horizontal thinkers—personnel capable of thinking broadly across disparate subject matters as well as conceptually. The devel- opment of a permanent professional Joint Staff officer corps, as opposed to the current temporary or “borrowed” Service staff officer concept, is needed to competently and quickly aggregate, transition, and disag- gregate ad hoc organizations in response to environmental demands. Training, educa- tion, promotion, and retention systems must be redesigned to facilitate member selection and development.</span></p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Facilities. <span class="p">A globally integrated operational concept requires facilities  around the world to be capable of supporting and sustaining the joint force. They must leverage advanced technology but also be capable of performing degraded operations. Operational, training, and educational orga- nizations must provide architecture, infra- structure, support, and cultural experiences that mirror the challenges of the operating environment. Facilities and supporting infra- structure must possess the flexibility to adapt</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">rapidly to changing conditions, missions, and organizational demands. Some inefficiencies</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">resulting from redundant infrastructure and capabilities must be tolerated to enhance effectiveness and reduce risk.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Organizations are deliberately struc- tured, goal-directed, social entities that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">reflect a deep understanding of the strategic environment. The concept of globally inte- grated operations represents the Chairman’s profound grasp of the current and future environmental complexities and the role the joint force must play in attaining national security objectives. To operate effectively and successfully in this dynamic environ- ment, DOD must redesign its entire enter- prise to include not only its organizational structure but also the associated doctrine, training, materiel, leadership, education, personnel, and facilities needed to imple- ment and support this concept.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The DOD organizational design of 25 years ago reflected the stability and certainty within the strategic environment then. Today and in the future, the speed of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">change in an age of technological innovation and globalization means there are no longer any certainties for the DOD enterprise.

The intent here is not to endorse one organiza- tional construct over another, or to address the specific advising skills and/or education and training needed to effectively influence behavior in an advisory role. Rather, the purpose is to highlight key elements for con- sideration by senior leaders in creating an</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">effective mission environment for ministe- rial institutional capacity-building.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Background</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Given experiences in Iraq and Afghan- istan, much has been written recently about the need for changes in the U.S. approach to BPC/SFA—from how we train and organize within the Department of Defense (DOD)  to how we partner with other nations and governmental and nongovernmental agen-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">cies. Scott Wuestner, for example, proposes a Security Advisory and Assistance Command (SAAC) as the “capstone proponent”<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61"> </span>of his detailed force structure operational concept. Under Wuestner’s concept, SAAC is a U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Table of Distribution and Allowances unit responsible for all DOD BPC/SFA issues,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">be informally or poorly defined or funda- mentally different from ours.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The following assessments regarding advising in the Iraqi Ministry of Interior (MOI) are certainly applicable to the advis- ing mission in Iraq’s Ministry of Defense (MOD), and are based on the authors’ expe- riences in 2007–2008. According to the Libra Advisory Group seminar report:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The U.S. military deployed a large number of advisors into Iraqi ministries including the MOI to work on developing manage- ment capacity. . . .

Specifics of the synchronized engage- ment strategy are constantly refined (or com- pletely overhauled) based on change of com- mander’s intent, redefined security posture, and maturation of institutional capacity. Continuous multiple feedback loops must</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">be included to make an effective assessment. Lessons learned and best practices should be captured and communicated. The “Direct Inject” line bypassing the ministry develop- ment target recognizes that factors such as the security situation may dictate immediate results largely independent of institutional capacity-building. This may take the form  of direct infusion of multinational funds to generate and train host nation troops during early or “surge” stages of assistance.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The remainder of the discussion focuses on the four key elements of the stra-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of Defense capability in order to generate and replenish Iraqi joint forces and develop Ministry level institutional capacity.” The need to replace U.S. and coalition forces with Iraqi forces to perform basic security func- tions (force generation) in a timely manner can easily overwhelm the development of the ministerial management functions (institu- tional capacity) needed to support them.

The security situation largely dictates the balance between them. The U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, which includes “developing more self reliant Afghan security forces,”<span class="s60">12</span><span class="s61"> </span>continues to place our coalition forces in this same force generation versus institutional capacity balancing act, which can create, in essence, a moving target that exacerbates an already complex and dynamic environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;"><i><b>Engage with a Unified Strategy</b></i><b>. </b>As stated in the <i>Commander’s Handbook for Security Force Assistance</i>, one of the SFA imperatives is to “ensure unity of effort/ unity of purpose.”<span class="s60">13</span><span class="s61"> </span>This is another basic premise that can easily be ignored in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">our haste to get to the job of “advising.” In the current context, unity of effort is interpreted as engaging the MOD with  a synchronized strategy—synchronized in message, in approach, and in a timely</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">manner with key Iraqi MOD process mile- stones. Clearly, this necessitates an under- standing and communication of Iraqi pro- cesses. It also comes down to commander’s intent and focus, as well as affording means for and encouraging frank, open, and honest communication and feedback. One</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">such example is presented in the “Ensure Appropriate Feedback” section below.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Additionally, the MNSTC-I interim reorganization itself helped facilitate an improved engagement strategy by aligning “its structure more effectively to support building MoD and MoI capacity in these key institutional functions.”<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">4 </span>The DDA was stood up to better synchronize the efforts  of the five advisory teams previously men- tioned within the areas managed by FCTs: acquisition of people, training and develop- ment, force management, budget, acquisi- tion of materiel, and sustainment.

Any change to a resource in any one functional area is likely to affect most if not all of the other functions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The point here is not to endorse an organizational structure—the DDA was the right choice at the right time and was</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">cultural lens are keys to establishing inf lu- ential relationships.

In the current context, it was not until the January 2008 MNSTC-I reorganization that key MOD processes were identified, cataloged, and discussed regularly by coalition DDA forces; MNSTC-I was established in June 2004. During the standup of the DDA organization in January–February 2008, over 50 processes, some more formal than others, were identified in the various functional areas (acquisition of people, training and development, and force man- agement, among others). While not every advisor could or should be expected to fully understand each of these processes, having knowledge of and access to those processes that affect decisions made in that advisor’s area are needed. For example, an advisor to the MOD Director General, Defense Policy and Requirements, has to have a good understanding of MOD budgeting and the key players in that process to help inf luence requirement decisions in a timely manner with budget decisions.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ensure Appropriate Feedback<span class="s66">. </span><span class="p">Continuous multiple feedback loops must occur in order for the strategic framework to be effective in the complex, dynamic SFA environment.

This is the “how are we doing” regarding the day-to-day busi- ness of developing ministerial institutional performance. To be most effective, this feed- back must be shared openly and honestly among the advisors who are the most visible face to the ministerial leaders and entire  SFA team. In this case, the FCTs focused on coordinating the engagement strategy with the advisors.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">For example, a weekly “sync meeting” was chaired by the DDA and attended by all key advisors and FCT leads. During</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the meeting, advisors shared important decisions and outcomes from crucial Iraqi meetings held within the MOD. Important insights into principal advisees’ cognitive maps and key formal or informal Iraqi</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">influencers were gleaned. Furthermore, FCT leads would highlight current and future issues within their functional areas based</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on their involvement with the five primary advising teams and interaction with the MOD. The feedback was provided in simple one-page summary formats developed during the reorganization standup and cataloged by date. Both of these important feedback mechanisms helped synchronize</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a common advisor engagement strategy with MOD principals and identify critical emerging issues potentially requiring the commanding general’s intervention.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The other feedback loops in figure 1 are more about the “how are we doing” regarding mission effects. For example,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">building and replenishing forces use metrics that are generally easier to define and measure. Ideally, the feedback loop from mission effects back to the host nation min- istry is developed by the host nation, but in the case of a newly developing ministry, it</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is likely that the SFA team would aid in the development of these metrics.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusions</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The establishment of an effective mission environment for ministerial institutional capacity-building is chal-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">lenging, especially when force generation is part of the mission set.

In fact, our own</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">authoritative guidance and numerous inde- pendent studies point out that one of the single biggest problems we face in perform- ing such missions is overcoming tendencies to impose Western-style processes without attempting to learn and use host nation processes, however ill-defined they may be. Such an approach, however well intended, is likely to prolong our involvement or, worse, hinder ultimate success.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The strategic framework presented here provides a simple but effective template for focusing advisory efforts aimed at devel- oping self-sustaining institutional capacity in host nation ministries. In doing so, it helps fill a crucial doctrinal gap in the BPC/ SFA mission area. Senior leader consider- ation of the four basic elements contained  in the model will help create a mission envi- ronment that facilitates effective advising at</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the ministerial level. The basis for the frame- work is proved through application within MNSTC-I in early 2008, which provided the context for the current presentation.

However, given that self-reliance is likely to remain one of our long-term objectives in these state-building efforts, commanders must effectively manage that balance in a focused, strategic manner.

Unfortu- nately, in today’s security environment, violent nonstate actors are increasingly operating from ungoverned spaces, with an expanding capacity to threaten international security and stability. These destabilizing elements blur the traditional distinction between law enforcement and warfare and create a gray area between routine policing activities and international armed conflict. Hence the global system, which has worked so well for over 360 years, might fray if the international community allows terrorists to thrive in the unregulated areas within sover- eign states’ borders. The international com- munity acknowledged the danger of these transnational actors in United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolution 1373, where</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">it called on all states to deny safe haven to those committing or facilitating terrorist acts.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61"> </span>Unfortunately, not all states are able to govern the entirety of their territories,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">creating the strategic dilemma of combating adversaries within nations with which we are not at war.</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since the end of World War II, the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">United States has fulfilled the role of</p><p class="s169" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 61pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">wo factors shape all discus- sions on security cooperation. First, when the Department of Defense (DOD) revised</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">its security cooperation doctrine, it did so assuming a relatively unrestricted environ- ment. Second, the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act, statu- tory authorities supporting U.S. security cooperation with foreign governments, were largely developed during the Cold</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">War. The former’s broad construct does not fully account for statutory authorities and the constraints of fiscal resources while the latter does not account for current global realities. Taken in combination, these two conditions limit the ability of the United States to use security cooperation for achiev- ing its objectives in fragile or failing states. The resulting disconnect creates varied policy interpretations and gaps that must be closed for effective security cooperation in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">security capacity builder. President Barack Obama reaffirmed this role in the May 2010 National Security Strategy, which states that Washington will support new UN frame- works and capacities for countering transna- tional threats to include counterterrorism. Specifically for Iraq, the National Security Strategy provides the goals of denying al Qaeda safe haven and building a positive partnership with the government of Iraq.<span class="s60">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The U.S. Government began its war termination and transition from a DOD-led</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="459" height="1" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_112.png"/></span></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;">Lieutenant General Robert L.

The forth was to facilitate Iraq’s reintegra- tion into the region as a responsible security partner through U.S. Central Command’s regional exercise program.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This four-pronged strategy was designed to enable OSC-I to complete all of its security assistance and security coopera- tion tasks in support of the overall strategic goals of the United States. Yet outdated statutory authorities not designed for today’s operating environment hinder security cooperation doctrinal task implementation. This doctrine and authorities mismatch has impeded implementing necessary “ways and means” to achieve strategic ends.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">DOD must analyze and more strictly define its security cooperation doctrine, which is presently spread over numerous publications, regulations, and manuals. DOD Directive 5132.03 defines <i>security cooperation </i>as “activities undertaken by the Department of Defense to encourage and enable international partners to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives. It includes all DOD interactions with foreign <i>defense and security </i>establish- ments.”<span class="s60">6</span><span class="s61"> </span>Joint Publication (JP) 1-02 defines <i>security cooperation </i>as “all Department of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">nition, not the broader definition within the DOD Directive, which challenges OSC-I’s ability to equip, advise, and train a security force that is organized outside Iraq’s Min- istry of Defense. This question of doctrinal responsibility further aggravates the debate about statutory authorities that will be high- lighted shortly.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management refers to <i>security cooperation </i>as “an umbrella term that is loosely defined and encompasses a variety of programs.”<span class="s60">8</span><span class="s61"> </span>Those programs are not</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">centrally managed. The most comprehensive list of security cooperation activities can be found in JP 3-22, <i>Foreign Internal Defense</i>, and the list finishes with the vague “other programs and activities.”<span class="s60">9</span><span class="s61"> </span>Competing doctrine, subject to varied interpretations, adds to the confusion among DOD and State Department policymakers as they attempt  to define OSC-I’s doctrinal responsibili-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ties and its subsequent connection to legal authorities.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">To resolve this issue, the first step would be for the Joint Staff to collate the doctrine for security cooperation activities into one comprehensive publication and assemble a team of defense professionals with experience in SCOs to analyze the doctrine to ensure it is consistent with law</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and that it sufficiently supports the goals of the current national strategy. Once DOD has completely and definitively identified its doctrinal requirements, it can turn the doc- trine over to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and DOD’s General Counsel to determine if the current policies and laws authorize the tactics and procedures DOD needs to perform in order to achieve the strategic objectives, which brings us to the issue of gaps in the authorities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gaps</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The second problem with security cooperation support involves inadequate existing legal authorities. The Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act, the main sources for OSC-I’s Title 22 authorities, were both developed during the Cold War. They remain relevant for</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">stable countries, but they are insufficient for security cooperation activities in fragile or failing states. Security cooperation activities in stable states support a materiel focus on force modernization. In fragile and failed</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of the Ministry of Defense forces and outside the capabilities of the Ministry of Interior forces. Transnational terrorist groups can overwhelm traditional police forces, particu- larly a nascent internal security capability in an emerging democracy. This is especially true in Iraq, where groups such as al Qaeda in Iraq and Asaib Ahl al-Haq need to be met by a paramilitary internal security force. Iraq’s burgeoning CTS requires training and equipping, and, as mentioned earlier, OSC-I and its predecessor organizations have been powerless to assist them without special leg- islative authority. While ISFF filled the void and bridged this statutory gap, a long-term solution would best support SCOs and U.S. strategic goals.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Absent ISFF or other special authori- ties, all OSC-I training and advisory mis- sions involving uniformed military personnel would cease. This fact reflects the inadequacies of the current statutory authorities, which support a robust security assistance program with Foreign Military Sales as its cornerstone but do not support</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">To avert segmentation in U.S. support caused by a gap in the 2012 special authori- ties, DOD responded by authorizing the use of the Combatant Commander Initia- tive Fund (CCIF) to continue the training</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">program, which was intended as a short-term solution until Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013. The use of CCIF allowed the continuation of the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">OSC-I training mission, but at the cost of approximately 20 percent of OSC-I person- nel because using the CCIF did not permit as broad a training mission as authorized under the ISFF. Moreover, there is a statu- tory limit of $5 million that may be used</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to train foreign military forces worldwide. Through hard work, unsung professionals within DOD, U.S. Central Command, and OSC-I temporarily resolved the problem, but this was yet another example of a temporary authority providing short-term relief to a systemic problem. A full-time solution is needed. Since the Arms Export Control</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Act and Foreign Assistance Act cannot meet America’s 21<span class="s60">s</span><span class="s61">t</span>-century postconflict requirements, we must develop legislation that enables SCOs to meet the future chal-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="462" height="4" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_114.png"/></span></p><p class="s79" style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: center;">failed and fragile frontline states require the full weight</p><p class="s79" style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: center;">of a security cooperation program encompassing both Title 10 and Title 22 provisions</p><p style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">lenges that face our nation. Said another way, Congress needs to rewrite these statutes in keeping with the new global paradigm. The</p><p class="s80" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: right;">                                                                                                                                                                        <span class="p">       June 2011 National Strategy for Counterter-</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">rorism describes this solution. It states that</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">states, force modernization is not enough. Those states require an SCO empowered to implement the force generation model to rebuild their military institutions. In recog- nition of this fact, Congress passed the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF) in 2006, which authorized U.S. forces to train and assist the ISF, which include counterterrorism forces, conventional military forces, and federal police. ISFF was the only authority that allowed OSC-I to complete all of the security cooperation tasks needed to produce Presi- dent Obama’s vision for Iraq, but regrettably it expired in September 2012 before all</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">the strategic objectives were reached and an adequate follow-on authority could be legislated.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">An additional complaint concerning the existing legal authorities is the statutory distinction between the Ministries of Inte- rior and Defense and internal and external security, which has not kept pace with the realities of the global environment. Many transnational actors with malicious intent operate in gray areas outside the legal reach</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">an enduring security cooperation program partnered with a frontline state. The failure of Congress to pass the National Defense Authorization Act before the end of FY12 was an additional inhibiting factor, as the interim Continuing Resolution did not provide the authorities needed for OSC-I to continue its security cooperation mission. This reflects another limitation to the reli- ance on special congressional authorities, which require annual congressional debate and renewal. Furthermore, both DOD and State have expressed a reluctance to bring the special authorities argument to Congress year after year. If the debate and approval process is accomplished in a seamless and timely manner, it does not hamper security cooperation or security assistance activities and may even be beneficial; however, if they are not completed in an expeditious manner, security assistance programs could suffer breaks in service and security cooperation missions could be fragmented. Either effect could signal a wavering commitment to our partners, reducing mutual trust.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the U.S. legal framework must “maintain sufficient flexibility to adjust to the changing threat and environment.”<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Today it does not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Blurred title 10 and title 22 Distinction</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The third problem with today’s secu- rity cooperation support is the misconcep- tion that the Foreign Military Sales program, under the auspice of the Title 22 security assistance mission, can continue to serve as the cornerstone of our allied partnerships. That was true for our support of Cold War allies who already had functioning govern- ments and military forces, but no longer. Today, the United States finds itself engaged with failed and fragile frontline states that lack established government institutions</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and robust military capabilities. Such states require the full weight of a security coopera- tion program encompassing both Title 10 and Title 22 provisions to generate forces and build military institutions that embody a professional ethos and are imbued with democratic values, are respectful of indi-</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="696" height="444" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_115.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Navy (Nathan Potter)</p><p class="s36" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Liberian coast guardsman discusses operations with U.S. Navy officer during exercise Saharan Express 2012 at counternarcotics and maritime security interagency operations center in Praia, Cape Verde</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">vidual and human rights, follow the rule of law, and are subordinate to civilian authori- ties. Until that conversation occurs between military and civilian decisionmakers, the laws will remain inflexible and will need- lessly constrain SCOs. Current statutes must be amended to permit SCOs to adjust to the situation on the ground, implementing a mixture of Title 10 and 22 programs in con- junction with their government partners as they work to build partner capacity in fragile or failed states.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">If the dynamic nature of the contem- porary environment and the flexibility required to operate within that environ- ment are not acknowledged, SCOs will be plagued by differing visions of their roles and responsibilities, which will lead to ineffective planning and resourcing. OSC-I suffered because of these varied opinions as it accepted the mantle from United States Forces–Iraq (USF-I).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">During the construction of OSC-I in 2011, a fundamental planning assumption went uncorrected even when proved false. USF-I planners originally assumed that</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">negotiations with Iraq for a Title 10 follow- on force would be successful and structured the organization to direct up to 10,000 soldiers. When that planning factor with- ered away, due primarily to the inability to conclude a status of forces agreement guar- anteeing legal immunity to the follow-on force, planners had no guidelines to readjust the organization’s structure to perform the required command and staff functions or the authority to redefine its endstate objec- tives commensurate to the structure it pos- sessed. Critical functions such as transporta- tion planning, movement coordination, and communications architecture development were orphaned when USF-I support staff departed. Instead of managing its primary security cooperation and assistance func- tions, OSC-I was forced to pull personnel from its Title 22 security assistance and cooperation missions to perform its internal Title 10 enabling capabilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The blurred Title 10 and Title 22 dis- tinction was even convoluted between U.S. Central Command’s component command- ers. Army Central did not believe it had the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">authority to provide Title 10 administrative support to OSC-I in such areas as cashing checks, direct exchanging of worn military uniforms, or even providing fixed-wing distinguished visitor support despite the fact that 75 percent of the organization was present under Title 10 authorities conduct- ing Title 10 security cooperation tasks. Yet</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. Air Forces Central believed it had the legal authority and sent a finance team to support OSC-I for 6 months at a time along with flying a C-130 ring route mission to Iraq two to three times a week.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As the organization’s structural short- comings were revealed during execution, continued disagreements over OSC-I’s secu- rity cooperation responsibilities inhibited the resourcing of potential organizational solutions. With Kurd-Arab tensions increas- ing in Iraq, the U.S. Mission Iraq recognized that the combined security mechanisms (CSM) could serve as a confidence-building measure, acting as an avenue for security forces to cooperate and discuss pertinent issues. Ambassador James Jeffrey and the USF-I commander, General Lloyd Austin III</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">(USA), proposed a joint manning document for OSC-I that included positions intended for those important military-to-military dis- cussions. The Kurds and Arabs both lever- age their relationships with the U.S. military to seek military advice and communicate with one another. The Kurds trust the U.S. military, while the Arabs use the military</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">SCOs, particularly for organizations such as OSC-I, operating in nonpermissive environ- ments and transitioning from a decade of armed conflict. Furthermore, after a decade of operating under special authorities and unprecedented interagency cooperation</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">that saw DOD conducting a police training program (a function normally executed by</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">needs, it must build the security capacities of its partners. Current challenges to security and stability necessitate changes in America’s system of providing that capacity. Our SCOs face those new challenges daily as they strive to conduct security cooperation activities to build partner capacity in support of develop- ing strategic partnerships. Even in a nonper- missive environment, all of those challenges can be met with updated, relevant statutes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="462" height="4" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_116.png"/></span></p><p class="s79" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Congress should recognize that effective security cooperation</p><p class="s79" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">requires the resources of both DOD and the State Department</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">properly aligned with doctrine.

Unfortunately, the State Department would not resource the task, and when the Kurd- Arab conflict erupted, the new Ambassador directed OSC-I support to enable the mili- tary-to-military discussions, which created an unscheduled personnel requirement that had to be resourced internally.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The lack of clarity regarding OSC-I status and the ability of DOD to provide Title 10 support to OSC-I arose when the State Department directed transfer of all OSC-I training sites to the government of Iraq and the transition of all base life support and security functions to the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Foreign Military Sales contractors. OSC-I had previously closed the Kirkuk training site in September 2012. For that mission,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. Central Command provided logisti- cal support through an exception to policy under Operation <i>New Dawn </i>authorities,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">which continued through FY12, even though USF-I was deactivated in December 2011. However, the Office of the Secretary of Defense terminated Operation <i>New Dawn </i>authorities at the end of FY12, which pre- vented DOD and U.S. Central Command from providing the same logistical support to the subsequent site transfers despite the fact that almost everything to be disposed</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of was legacy USF-I equipment and DOD was issuing disposition instructions for the remaining equipment at the sites.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This example illustrates that current budgetary and funding rules unnecessar- ily restrict logistical support to traditional</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the State Department) and Foreign Service officers serving on Provincial Reconstruc- tion Teams alongside Active-duty Service- members (a postconflict stability operation traditionally executed by DOD), the abrupt postconflict return to a traditional Title 10 and Title 22 divide is a significant step back- ward for both agencies. Congress should recognize that effective security cooperation requires the resources of both DOD and the State Department and allows greater use of DOD resources to support organizations such as OSC-I, particularly in a postconflict transition paradigm.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">We must achieve that flexibility. During a speech that former secretary of Defense Robert Gates gave to the assembled body of future military leaders at West Point on February 25, 2011, he warned, “Any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa ‘should have his head examined.’”<span class="s60">11</span><span class="s61"> </span>The implication for us is to think of how to fight wars differently—specifically how to address the strategic dilemma of defeating an adversary who resides within a country with which we are not at war. One answer to this challenge is mentioned in DOD’s latest strategic guidance, <i>Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership</i>, which states, “Whenever pos- sible, we will develop innovative, low cost, and small-footprint approaches to achieve our security objectives, relying on exercises, rotational presence, and advisory capabili- ties.”<span class="s60">12</span><span class="s61"> </span>These small footprint capabilities exist within our SCOs today, but we have</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to ensure they have the right doctrine, are organized for their missions, are resourced to accomplish their objectives, and have the proper authorities to enable those resources.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">If America truly wants to forge a new global architecture to provide for its security</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="220" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_117.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">consider OSC-I’s experiences as a basis to verify that its doctrinally sound, government- sanctioned support capabilities match the support requirements of the 21<span class="s60">s</span><span class="s61">t </span>century.

Indeed, since the end of 2003 when the total ANSF consisted of approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">6,000 personnel, both the ANA and the ANP have grown significantly. By March 2012,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the total number of ANSF personnel, includ- ing forces from the Ministry of Defense</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and Ministry of the Interior, had grown to some 344,000.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61"> </span>Despite problems of person- nel retention and overall troop quality, the ANSF has grown quite rapidly.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Yet concomitant with the rise in security forces is a rise in green-on-blue attacks—attacks where Afghan security forces (also known as “insiders”) target coalition personnel. By September 2012, for example, Afghan security forces killed 18 British soldiers, while a roughly equal number were wounded in similar attacks.<span class="s60">6</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Indeed, according to some fairly comprehen- sive statistics compiled by <i>Long War Journal</i>, 72 green-on-blue attacks occurred from 2008 to the end of 2012. Of all the casual- ties suffered by coalition forces in 2012, an estimated 15 percent were caused by Afghan forces attacking U.S. and ISAF personnel.<span class="s60">7</span><span class="s61"> </span>As outlined in the accompanying table, the <i>absolute </i>number of green-on-blue attacks has been escalating since 2008, with more insider attacks and more coalition fatalities each year.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Given the expansion of the ANSF, an absolute increase in the number of insider attacks would be expected, as more soldiers lead to more chances for insider attacks, just as larger cities tend to have more murders and violent crimes. In this sense, at least part of the increase in green-on-blue attacks is,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as British Brigadier General Doug Chalmers points out, “statistical.”<span class="s60">8</span><span class="s61"> </span>What matters more in some ways is the <i>relative </i>rate of green-on- blue attacks, or the number of insider attacks that occur relative to the number of Afghan security personnel. As illustrated in row 5</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of the table, the relative number of attacks has been growing as well, with the ratio of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">extent of counterinsurgency control in Afghanistan. These variables interact to produce higher levels of insider attacks in both absolute and relative terms. The expan- sion of the indigenous security capacity of the Afghan state contributes primarily to  the absolute increase in attacks. A low and potentially waning span of counterinsurgent control over the territory and population of Afghanistan contributes to the relative rise in attacks that have occurred since 2008.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">At its core, the growing number of indigenous security personnel contributes to a higher <i>absolute </i>level of green-on-blue</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">violence through personally held individual- level motivations, which are highly variable but can range from comparatively simple grievances over U.S. and ISAF actions to full- blown allegiance to the Taliban insurgency. As highlighted in row three of the table, the <i>absolute </i>number of green-on-blue attacks</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is rising. Moreover, for any given baseline level of discontent with U.S. and ISAF forces among the Afghan population, the growth of the ANSF should result in more people within the security apparatus who want to attack coalition forces.<span class="s60">9</span><span class="s61"> </span>For instance, Lieu- tenant Colonel Charlie Maconochie writes, “The catalyst for the majority of insider</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">attacks appears to be a mix of personal griev- ances, cultural disparities and psychological distress. The largely unreported number</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of attacks by Afghan soldiers on their own forces bears this out.”<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Individually held grievances provide the motive, but the expansion of the ANSF must happen before an aggrieved individual has an opportunity to enter the Afghan security apparatus to then undertake an attack.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">An expanding number of indigenous security personnel also means more poten-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">tial for insurgent infiltration. For example, Mullah Mohammad Omar, the leader of the Taliban, reportedly claimed on August 16, 2012, that the perpetrators of many of the green-on-blue attacks were “cleverly infil- trated in the ranks of the enemy according  to the plan given to them last year.”<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">1 </span>Invari- ably, a larger security apparatus spreads thin the counterinsurgency’s finite resources for screening, monitoring, and controlling new recruits, which makes increased insurgent infiltration more likely.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In these myriad ways, rapidly building up the ANSF contributes to an increased number of insider acts. Yet the evidence over the 2008 to 2011 period suggests that the baseline level of grievances within the Afghan population is declining. Moreover, accord- ing to annual surveys conducted by the Asia Pacific Foundation, from 2008 through 2011 at the national level, an increasing number</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of Afghans indicated that Afghanistan is heading in the “right” direction.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">2 </span>In 2008, only 38 percent of respondents indicated that the country was heading in the right direc- tion. This number grew to 42 percent in 2009, 47 percent in 2010, and 46 percent in 2011. Admittedly, the number of people expressing the view that the country was moving in the wrong direction rose to 35 percent in 2011, but only after declining from 32 percent in 2008 to 27 percent in 2010. Basically, at one</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="458" height="466" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_120.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Navy (Jacob Dillon)</p><p class="s36" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">During Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program, insurgent commander turns in weapon and urges others to follow and renounce their affiliation with insurgency</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">level at least, the national statistics imply that the baseline level of grievance is likely improving over time, which means that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">it cannot really account for the <i>relative </i>increase in green-on-blue attacks in recent years. If anything, as grievances decline, the <i>relative </i>rate of insider attacks against U.S. and ISAF soldiers should decline, which is the opposite of what is happening.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Overall, more indigenous security forces will likely lead to more green-on-blue attacks because more aggrieved people</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">will enter the security apparatus and there will be more chances for direct insurgent infiltration. However, normalized around the number of security forces on active duty, the <i>relative </i>rate of attacks likely would not change unless the baseline level of grievances in the local population changed for the worse or U.S. and ISAF screening measures were overwhelmed by an influx of new recruits. As the data presented at least tentatively illustrate, grievances are diminishing over time at the national level even as the <i>relative </i>number of green-on-blue attacks is rising.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The most likely driver of the <i>relative </i>increase in green-on-blue attacks is the changing span of counterinsurgent control over the population and territory of Afghan- istan.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">3 </span>The level of control that a counter- insurgency can exercise in a territorial area affects the actions of both the population and the insurgency.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">4 </span>People generally col- laborate with the counterinsurgency in areas of high counterinsurgent control and refuse to do so in contested or insurgent-controlled areas because the population fears it will be punished by insurgents.

In zone A of the figure, the lowest value</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on the counterinsurgent control axis is represented—meaning that the counterin- surgency controls the lowest amount of the territory and population of Afghanistan. Assuming that indigenous troops are at</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a medium to high level, low counterin- surgent control results in a higher level of insider attacks—a high value on the y-axis. If counterinsurgent control expands—a movement to the right on the x-axis—then for any given level of indigenous security capacity, the number of insider attacks should fall. Indeed, if counterinsurgent control of Afghanistan approached a maximum value, then even the highest level of indigenous troop levels would not necessarily lead to higher levels of green- on-blue attacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In some ways, counterinsurgent control can be furthered by increasing indigenous troop levels, so the x- and z-axes are not completely independent. However, a counterinsurgency’s span of control over ter- ritory and population is the product of more than just security force levels, so a move- ment along the z-axis (growing indigenous troop levels) will not necessarily produce a similar movement along the x-axis (growing counterinsurgent control).<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">9 </span>This means that an expansion of the counterinsurgency’s span of control will usually lag indigenous troop development. In the context of the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">control. The mechanism that transforms expanding indigenous troop levels into increased insider attacks is the individual- level motivations of recruits and current personnel. More indigenous troops mean more opportunities for disaffected individuals to join the ANSF and target coalition forces. Likewise, a larger ANSF recruitment process results in a greater chance that insurgents will be able to infiltrate the process. An increase</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in indigenous troop levels is therefore defi- nitely related to higher levels of green-on-blue attacks in an absolute sense. All else being equal, as the size of Afghanistan’s indigenous security apparatus increases, so will the total number of insider attacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The span of counterinsurgency control over the territory and population of Afghanistan involves the extent to which</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">factors external to the individual—primarily</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the insurgency’s ability to coerce individuals through their families and dependents—can motivate a member of the Afghan security apparatus to launch a green-on-blue attack. When counterinsurgent control is low, the dependents and families of ANSF members are vulnerable to coercion and can be cred- ibly threatened by the insurgency. In that sense, counterinsurgent control is negatively related to more insider attacks. All else being equal, as the forces of the counterinsurgency expand their span of control over more of the territory and population of Afghanistan, the <i>relative </i>number of green-on-blue attacks should fall.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The accompanying figure outlines the relationship between expanding indigenous force size (z-axis), counterinsurgent control (x-axis), and insider or green-on-blue attacks (y-axis or dependent variable).<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">8</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">framework in the figure, there will be a movement along the z-axis (increased indigenous troops) that is greater than the movement along the x-axis (increased coun- terinsurgent control). The implication is that there will also be an increase upward along the y-axis, resulting in more green-on-blue attacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In sum, for any given level of indig- enous troops, the smaller the span of coun- terinsurgent control of the territory and population, the higher the <i>relative </i>number of insider attacks. Conversely, the higher the level of counterinsurgent control, the lower the level of insider attacks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Policy Conclusions</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The proposed framework for under- standing the drivers of green-on-blue attacks has both diagnostic and prognostic implica-</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">tions. In particular, the framework can diag- nose why there is currently an upswing in the <i>relative </i>number of green-on-blue attacks. It can also provide rough predictions of what will happen as Western countries reduce their presence in Afghanistan in 2014.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Diagnostically, the framework has interesting implications for both current and future state-building and counterinsurgency efforts. It suggests that absent a sufficiently high level of counterinsurgent control of the population and territory of an area of opera- tion, building indigenous security capacity is likely to result in a growing relative number of insider attacks. This diagnosis fits with what is currently happening in Afghanistan. While the indigenous security capacity of the Afghan state has grown significantly,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the span of counterinsurgent control of the territory and population has likely waned  or at least remained fairly low. The result is a growing relative number of green-on-blue attacks as the insurgency is able to coerce individuals within the ANSF into undertak- ing insider attacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">For current and future indigenous capacity development, the proposed frame- work suggests that increasing the span of counterinsurgent control must precede</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">any significant expansion in indigenous security capacity. Otherwise, higher levels of green-on-blue attacks are likely. To the extent the framework accurately describes the relationship between counterinsurgent control, indigenous security capacity, and green-on-blue attacks, it is clear that the need to develop indigenous capacity before handing over all security operations to the ANSF by 2014 has resulted in a rapid move- ment along the z-axis without a preceding or concomitant movement along the x-axis. The result, as expected, is an increased and rising number of green-on-blue attacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The framework can also provide a prognosis about what will happen with green-on-blue attacks as Western forces withdraw. Obviously, as the number</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of Western troops declines, the ability for ANSF personnel to launch attacks on Western counterinsurgents will fall.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">However, ANSF forces might still be targeted by elements within the indigenous security apparatus and the logic, as outlined in the framework above, should still apply. Since the span of counterinsurgent control over the population and territory of Afghanistan will likely decrease as Western forces are</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">withdrawn, the predicted expectation would be that the number of intrasecurity force attacks (green-on-blue and green-on-green) should probably rise further still.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Overall, the framework developed here has implications for both future counterin- surgency missions and the ongoing mission in Afghanistan. Counterinsurgent control of the population and territory of a theater of operations is crucial in limiting green-on- blue attacks because it minimizes the exter- nal motivator of such attacks, which revolves around the insurgency’s ability to coerce</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the families and dependents of indigenous forces into launching attacks. Put another way, building up the ANSF without first establishing a high enough level of effec- tive control over Afghanistan has resulted in another avenue through which the insurgency is able to attack coalition forces.

They identified three essential tasks for the Alli- ance going forward: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61"> </span>They adopted a new strategic concept that laid out the Alliance’s defense doctrine and vision for the 21<span class="s60">s</span><span class="s61">t </span>century. This called for</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a NATO that is more agile, capable, and cost-effective and that is able to defend its members against the full range of threats.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The new strategic concept is meant to guide the Alliance during the next 10 to 15 years as it restructures its forces accord- ing to new threat perceptions. The concept assesses that the greatest threats will come from the proliferation of nuclear weapons</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and other weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. It also recognizes that proliferation will be most acute in some of the world’s most volatile regions. Based on this assessment, the concept foresees a significant increase in NATO’s deterrence capability. One of the main tenets of that ambition is to develop a ballistic missile</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">defense (BMD) capability to pursue NATO’s core task of collective defense. The Lisbon declaration states, “We will . . . develop the capability to defend our populations and territories against ballistic missile attack</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as a core element of our collective defense, which contributes to the indivisible security of the Alliance. BMD will be one element of a broader response to the threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles.”<span class="s60">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This is a significant shift. The former emphasis on protecting military units and facilities based on theater missile defense has shifted to the protection of NATO members’</p><p class="s80" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">                                                                                                                                                                        <span class="p">       territories and populations based on ter-</span></p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;">Karen Kaya is a Middle East/Turkey Analyst for the Foreign Military Studies Office, a leading open-source research organization within the Department of Defense.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ritorial missile defense, signaling a broader, more comprehensive approach to security.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In addition to the Cold War–era threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, NATO faces threats today that were not present during that era including terrorist activities, cyber attacks against communication systems, threats</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">against energy security, and piracy activities along sea trade routes. What also makes these new threats unique is that they no longer originate with rational actors such</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">as the Soviet Union and therefore cannot be easily deterred. They come from irrational actors—governmental or nongovernmen- tal—who use asymmetrical tactics and are willing to die; thus, they are increasingly hard to counter. They come from actors who will not differentiate between military and civilian targets. NATO’s incentive to estab- lish missile defense systems and its shift from protecting military bases to protecting populations and full territories is meant to counter these threats.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This represents another major trans- formation within the Alliance’s posture. The focus is shifting from deterrence by mutu- ally assured destruction or extended deter- rence to deterrence by denial.<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61"> </span>The extended deterrence guarantee during the Cold War was meant to deter an attack on U.S. Allies with the message that such an attack would not be left unpunished, and would be met with nuclear weapons if necessary. In deter- rence by denial, the message is that the United States and NATO will prevent an attack from reaching its target and, there- fore, its political and military goal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Missile Defense Shield</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">President Ronald Reagan initially envisioned a missile defense shield project during the Cold War called the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). SDI was to use space technology to protect the United States from a nuclear attack. However, this project caused a crisis between the United States  and Soviet Union in the 1980s, and it was eventually abandoned due to cost and to important steps taken in nonproliferation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">During President George W. Bush’s term, the project came back on the agenda, and this time protection from Iran and North Korea was the goal. This plan foresaw the stationing of U.S. Patriot air-defense missiles in Poland and the planned deploy- ment of supporting radar in the Czech Republic. Agreements were signed with both countries in 2008. This project was</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">suspended because it caused a rift both in U.S.-Russia and in NATO-Russia relations.<span class="s60">4</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">President Barack Obama took a dif- ferent approach to the project in an effort to avoid the previous problems. First, it was turned into a NATO project, which was to reduce the cost burden on the United States and divert emphasis away from the United States. Second, instead of the long-range antiballistic missile defense system, the project would take a phased approach and start with short- to mid-range defense mis- siles that could be launched from land or sea. It would evolve by 2020 to its ultimate capability of protecting the U.S. homeland from an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the long term.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61"> </span>This would protect the United States and its NATO</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Allies from any attack by North Korea, Iran, or Syria. Third, the NATO declarations regarding this project have all indicated a desire to cooperate with Russia in order to mitigate its concerns.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">On September 17, 2009, as part of this phased approach, President Obama signed the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) document, which foresaw a missile defense system in a four-phase adaptive approach, with each phase building and improving on the technology of the previ- ous one.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Phased Approach</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The European Phased Adaptive Approach, as originially adopted, entailed a short-term and immediate goal to defend</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">against threats from tactical and short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and expanded by phases to protecting from medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) to intermediate- range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) and to even- tually protect against ICBMs. The first three phases involve the protection of U.S. Allies in Europe against ballistic missile threats. The fourth phase, which was initially fore- seen for 2020—then delayed to 2022—would protect the U.S. homeland against ICBMs, hitting them while they are in the Middle East or Europe. In March 2013, this phase was canceled after a decision to restructure missile defense plans and allegedly shift resources to protect against threats from North Korea.<span class="s60">6</span></p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Phase One (Accomplished in the 2011 Timeframe). <span class="p">This phase deployed missile defense systems that were already available. It included the Standard Missile</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">3 (SM-3), a ship-based missile system used by the U.S. Navy and a part of the sea-based Aegis BMD System. This ship system uses an interceptor called Block</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">IA, which is designed to intercept short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. This phase also includes the deployment of the Forward-based Mode Army Navy/Trans- portable Radar Surveillance System (AN/ TPY-2) to address regional ballistic missile threats to Europe. Currently, the AN/TPY-2 radar is hosted in Malatya’s Kürecik district in southeast Turkey and is operational.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">An Aegis BMD cruiser armed with SM-3 Block IA missiles was deployed to the Mediterranean, off the coast of Spain, on March 7, 2011, and has a home port in Rota, Spain. The Command Center in Ramstein, Germany, is also operational.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Phase Two (2015 Timeframe). <span class="p">This phase will see an upgrade of the technology on the Aegis ships in the Mediterranean  and the addition of a land-based Aegis BMD (Aegis Ashore) system in Romania. These</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">systems will have the SM-3 interceptor Block IB, which will have more advanced sensors, expanding the defended area. SM-3 IB</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">will also offer improved capability against maneuvering ballistic missiles or warheads. With Block IB, the Navy will gain the ability to defend against short- and medium-range missiles and some IRBMs. This technology is currently in the testing phase.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Phase Three (2018 Timeframe). <span class="p">After development and testing are complete,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">this phase will see the deployment of the more advanced and more maneuverable SM-3 Block IIA variant to counter short-, medium-, and intermediate-range missile threats. Phase three will see an addition of an Aegis Ashore BMD in Poland.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Phase Four (Planned for the 2020 Timeframe, but Later Abandoned). <span class="p">After planning, development, and testing were complete, this phase was to deploy the more advanced SM-3 Block IIB to help better cope with medium- and intermediate-range missiles and potential future ICBM threats to the U.S. homeland.

The radar in Turkey will also identify the trajectory of the mis- siles and relay the data to Aegis ships. The missiles on the ships will instantly launch against Iranian missiles, neutralizing the threat in its earliest stage. It will take a matter of seconds for the system to work.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">At the NATO Summit in Chicago in May 2012, the NATO missile defense system was officially declared to have reached interim operational capability. The command of the radar in Turkey was</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">officially transferred from the United States to NATO. This control arrangement will apply only to the radar system in Turkey; the systems in Poland, Romania, and on U.S. warships will remain under U.S. control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">threat from Iran</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The strategic concept adopted in Lisbon in 2010 states, “The Alliance does not consider any country to be its</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">adversary. However, no one should doubt NATO’s resolve if the security of any of its members are threatened. . . . NATO will</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">. . . develop the capability to defend our populations and territories against ballistic</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">missile attack as a core element of our col- lective defense, which contributes to the indivisible security of the Alliance.”</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The official line, as stated in NATO speeches and documents, is that the system is designed to protect against missiles in 30 countries. The May 2012 document adopted in Chicago also does not single out any par- ticular country or state: “Ballistic missiles pose an increasing threat to Allied popula- tions, territory and deployed forces. Over  30 countries have, or are acquiring, ballistic missile technology that can eventually be</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">used to carry not just conventional warheads, but also weapons of mass destruction.”<span class="s60">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Regardless of what official NATO documents state, however, it appears that the system is mainly aimed against the threat from Iran’s short- and medium-range ballistic missiles and its developing ICBM capabilities. Former U.S. documents state that Iran is perceived as the main threat. For</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">example, the 2009 White House EPAA docu- ment included a threat assessment that stated that the EPAA was based on an assessment  of the Iranian missile threat. The emphasis on Iran was also possibly a way to deflect Russian concerns. The document stated:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">We have repeatedly made clear to Russia that missile defense in Europe poses no threat to</p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">its strategic deterrent. Rather, the purpose is to strengthen defenses against the growing Iranian missile threat. There is no substitute for Iran complying with its international obligations regarding its nuclear program. But ballistic missile defenses will address the threat from Iran’s ballistic missile programs, and diminish the coercive influence that Iran hopes to gain by continuing to develop these destabilizing capabilities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Iran is a significant concern to NATO members. It has the largest force of ballistic missiles in the Middle East, and the threat from its short- and medium-range ballistic missiles is now assessed as developing more rapidly than previously projected. A nuclear Iran would create a proliferation spiral across the Middle East, effectively ending international nonproliferation efforts. As</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a sponsor of terrorism, Iran would be able to transfer nuclear materials to its terrorist proxies, threaten Israel, and seek to domi- nate the energy rich Persian Gulf.<span class="s60">8</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Russia’s Response</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The strategic concept laid out at the Lisbon Summit included a segment on revitalizing NATO-Russia relations and cooperation with Russia. The Chicago Declaration reaffirmed NATO’s assurance</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to Russia, stating that the project was not oriented against Russia, nor did the project have the capability of undermining Russia’s strategic deterrent.<span class="s60">9</span><span class="s61"> </span>However, no matter how much the Alliance tries to calm Russian concerns, or refrains from naming a specific threat, its Phase Four would have capability against some of Russia’s strategic forces. This is factored into Russian concerns and threat calculations, which are based on capability, not intentions.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Even though</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">this phase was canceled in March 2013, it is unclear whether Russian concerns have eased completely.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Moscow opposes the planned missile defense system; it is worried that the system could threaten the country’s own nuclear missiles and undermine its deterrence capa- bility. Nicolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non- Proliferation, claims the Russians assess that Iran is still far from long-range missile capability. Hence, they think the real target of the missile defense system is Russia, not countries that have or are acquiring ballistic missile technologies as is being publicly declared.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">1 </span>Furthermore, Russia perceives that merely the presence of the missile defense shield increases the risk of Iran being attacked, weakening one of Russia’s allies in the region.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Russian Ministry of Defense officials want legal and written guarantees that U.S. missile defense systems will not be directed against Russian strategic missiles. Moreover, while Russia wants to operate a joint system in which both sides would have control over any decision to launch interceptor mis-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">siles, NATO wants to have two separate but coordinated command and control systems that share information.<span class="s60">12</span><span class="s61"> </span>NATO rejected Russia’s plan in June 2011 when Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated at the Missile Defense Conference in London, “We cannot outsource our collective defense obligations to non-NATO members.”<span class="s60">13</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">These issues remain unresolved. In early May 2012, officials from NATO, the United States, and Russia met in Moscow at a Missile Defense Conference for 2 days of talks in an effort to find common ground. On May 3, 2012, Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov stated that the United States and Russia had not been able to find a mutually acceptable solution and that the situation was practically at a “dead-end.”<span class="s60">14</span><span class="s61"> </span>There has not been much progress since.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Russian officials have stated that Russia reserves the right to strike NATO’s radars unless it is given the clear written guarantees it wants. After the meeting, General Nikolai Makarov, chief of the Russian defense staff, remarked, “A decision to use destructive force pre-emptively will be taken if the situ- ation worsens.” Makarov also stated that if the European shield was built, Russia would respond by putting more powerful warheads on its own ballistic missiles.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Russia’s military has also announced plans to develop a new ICBM capable of carrying multiple warheads and other com- ponents designed to penetrate U.S. missile defenses. On May 23, 2012, Russia tested a new missile that would have the capability to break the NATO defense system. The timing was significant in that it came days after NATO’s Chicago Summit, during which the Alliance formally announced the achievement of the first phase of the system. This missile is believed to be more difficult to detect and easier to maneuver. It is also thought to potentially have individual war- heads that can change course to avoid being shot down.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">5</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">View from the Front Line</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO is Turkey’s anchor in the West. It is what institutionalizes Turkey’s ties with the West and forms the basis of its Western and European identity. In the last decade, however, Turkey’s foreign policy, which included better relations with Iran and Syria and worsening relations with Israel, raised questions about whether it was deliberately distancing itself from the West and was</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">still a trustworthy NATO Ally. Such talks of a shift in orientation from West to East were ignited primarily because Ankara’s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">initial approach to Tehran’s nuclear program was significantly different from that of its Western Allies. It focused less on Iran’s capabilities and more on its intentions, believing it would never be the target of Iranian nukes. Accordingly, in June 2010, Turkey voted against further sanctions against Iran at the United Nations Security Council, causing a serious crisis in its rela- tions with the United States and Europe and fueling discussions about the West having lost Turkey.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">6 </span>The deterioration in Turkey’s relations with Israel following the May 2010 flotilla incident added fuel to the fire.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This was the atmosphere in which Turkey attended the November 2010 meeting</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in Lisbon. The United States and NATO had decided that Iran was the main threat to world peace and stability. The strategic concept included a BMD project that would employ military tools to deter Iran from becoming a regional nuclear power. When confronted with the BMD project, Ankara had two options. Either it would approve it and reaffirm its position within the Alli- ance, or reject it and raise serious questions about its position in NATO, altering its relations with both NATO and the United States. Turkey chose to approve the strategic concept. (In an effort to do some damage</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">control in its relations with Iran, it sought to ensure that the documents refrained from identifying Iran as the threat against which the shield would be deployed. It got what it wanted, but this has not convinced Iran.)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In September 2011, Turkey went a step further and agreed to host the radar station as part of the BMD project. In this context, Turkey’s decision is not only military or technical but also political. It has clarified the country’s long-term strategic orienta- tion and cemented its position in NATO. In fact, in a May 21, 2012, article in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, Nicholas Burns, former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, claimed that NATO members should offer a greater leadership role to Turkey and consider a Turkish Secre- tary-General to lead the Alliance within the next decade.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">What were Turkey’s calculations when it not only accepted the project, but also agreed to host the radar? First, it appears it has changed its assessment of Iran’s nuclear program. It is adopting a more realistic approach regarding Iran, shifting its focus from the peaceful or hostile intentions of Iran’s nuclear program to the importance and necessity of balancing a nuclear Iran’s rising regional influence. If Iran becomes</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a nuclear power, the strategic advantage would change the power balance in the Middle East, a region where Turkey wants increased influence. Second, the uncer- tainty of events in the Middle East following the Arab Spring demonstrates that Turkey cannot remain friendly with regimes like neighboring Iran and Syria, and this has increased the importance of NATO for Turkey. In early 2013, Turkey’s requests for and deployment of Patriot missiles from NATO to protect against potential threats from Syria have also highlighted its depen- dence on the Alliance.</p><p class="s56" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Iran’s First target Will Be turkey</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Turkey’s decision to host the NATO BMD radar system in the southeastern part of its country, 435 miles west of the Iranian border, has caused a serious headache in its relations with Iran.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">8 </span>Iranian officials have bashed Turkey’s plans to host the radar</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">for the NATO missile shield, which they perceive as a U.S.-led plot to protect Israel in case Israel attacks Iran’s nuclear facilities and is faced with a counterattack by Iran.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">country in mind and has expressed its opposition to identifying Iran explicitly as a potential attacker. It has also vehemently opposed sharing any intelligence gained from the radar with Israel. Nevertheless, the BMD project will automatically create a security umbrella that will protect Israel</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">against Iran’s ballistic missiles.

Iranian Brigadier General Hacizade stated:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">We have prepared ourselves.

In today’s world, the Zionist regime <span class="p">[Israel] </span>conducts its acts with the U.S., and the U.S. conducts its acts as NATO.

It has repeatedly stated that the radar system is not being positioned with any particular</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">government’s popularity domestically and in the Middle East.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">1 </span>The radar’s placement in Turkey has now caused a debate in the Middle East regarding claims that Turkey is protecting Israel and has been insincere in its statements against Tel Aviv.<span class="s60">22</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In February 2012, during NATO Sec- retary-General Rasmussen’s visit to Ankara in honor of Turkey’s 60<span class="s60">t</span><span class="s61">h </span>anniversary of NATO membership, Turkish officials obtained his assurances that intelligence would not be shared with Israel. Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu also stated that “NATO’s resources and facilities can only be used among NATO members and within the NATO Alliance. . . . We will never allow any NATO facility to be used by a third party. I am making this very clear. If the third party is Israel, then our position is even clearer.”<span class="s60">23</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Regarding its staunch refusal to share intelligence with Israel, the main question is why Turkey would insist on withholding intelligence that could destroy a nuclear warhead in the air and potentially prevent incredible civilian loss. The government has not given a satisfactory answer to this question. The most likely reason is that it would like to create some kind of consis- tency and balance within its Middle East policies. It cannot appear to be supporting Israel’s strategic defense while at the same time trying to gain inf luence in the Middle East by taking an adversarial stance against Israel. This stance has included statements about the possibility of military conf lict with Israel. With the reinstatement of rela- tions between Israel and Turkey in spring 2013, it remains to be seen whether this stance will soften.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of the NATO BMD, while, on the other, it places great importance on its f ledgling political, economic, and especially energy ties with Russia.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In addition to Russia and Iran, Turkey is concerned about Syrian missiles due to  the latest tensions between the countries. Turkey fears that the Syrian regime may arm its long-range Scud missiles with chemical warheads and direct them at Turkey.<span class="s60">25</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Collective Defense</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">NATO’s vision is to become an alli- ance that strengthens collective security through measures intended to counter the new threats of the 21<span class="s60">s</span><span class="s61">t </span>century. Its focus is shifting from protecting military units to protecting populations and territories, sug- gesting a broader mission. It is also changing its posture from deterrence by mutually assured destruction to deterrence by denial against a broader array of potential threats. This includes a BMD shield that will eventu- ally cover Europe and the United States.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The shield is problematic for Iran and Russia. The very presence of the missile defense shield could increase Iran’s per- ceived risk of being attacked, prompting a preemptive strike. Iran’s threat to target Tur- key’s radar has already soured relations.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Turkey’s decision to host the NATO BMD radar is significant. It is an indication of the role Turkey intends to play within the Alliance in the 21<span class="s60">s</span><span class="s61">t </span>century. It puts an end to debates about a “shifting axis” and its relevance in NATO and clarifies the country’s long-term strategic orientation. It</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is significant that Turkey made this decision knowing it would jeopardize its relations with Syria, Iran, and Russia.

As the country on the front line, Turkey will likely have to continue to play a balancing act between its geopolitical need to coexist with its neighbors, Iran and Syria and nearby Russia, and its role within NATO. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">No t e S</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l36"><li style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;"><a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/offi-" class="a" target="_blank">North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), “NATO Active Engagement, Modern Defence: Strategic Concept for the Defence and Security of the Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization adopted by Heads of State and Government in Lisbon,” November 19, 2010, available at &lt;www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/offi</a>- cial_texts_68580.htm&gt;.

The idea is to establish two NATO-Russia missile defense centers where NATO and Russian officers would work together. The first, the NATO-Russia Missile Data (MD) Fusion Centre, would pool data from NATO and Russian sensors to form a common diagnosis of possible third-country missile launches. This would be fed into the second, the NATO-Russia MD Planning and Operations Center. There, NATO and Russian officers would develop plans for intercepting missiles that may be launched. The second center would also develop concepts of operations, rules of engagement, and preplanned responses for coordinated missile defense opera- tions that could be implemented in the event of an actual attack. Under this arrangement, NATO and Russia would carry out missile intercepts through their separate command and control systems, but there would be cooperation through- out the intercept process.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">Tom Z.

The latest version is the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">European allies and deployed U.S. forces from a missile attack by Iran. It does not protect the U.S. homeland, and is less than robust against sophisticated attack configura- tions. Current homeland-deployed midcourse and terminal defense systems unfortunately do not provide the missing robustness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">BMD has been under uneven develop- ment for more than four decades. It has  been configured with nuclear, X-ray, particle beam, high-energy laser (HEL), explosive fragmentation, and, finally, kinetic energy kill mechanisms. It has survived mistaken strategic barriers including a treaty that per-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">petuated mutual assured destruction (MAD) and the notion that BMD unavoidably pro- moted first strike instability. It has encoun- tered political hurdles that constrained the use of space for weaponry, even defensive weaponry. Although those impediments have not been entirely overcome, there is encouraging progress rooted both in techno- logical advances and in a somewhat relaxed political environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The lack of credible ballistic missile defense shaped strategic nuclear concepts throughout much of the latter half of the 20<span class="s60">th</span><span class="s61"> </span>century. It led to the MAD strategy, variants of which are still in place. MAD derived from very large nuclear stockpiles, typically 10,000 warheads on opposing sides, is driven by game-theoretic issues of first strike stabil- ity, and puts a substantial part of the world’s population at risk. Fortunately, following several arms limitation agreements, nuclear stockpiles were reduced by almost an order of magnitude, and concurrently missile defense matured considerably. As missile defenses improve and nuclear stockpiles undergo further shrinkage, the MAD strat- egy will likely approach obsolescence.<span class="s60">1</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The widespread perception that missile defense had insurmountable drawbacks significantly inf luenced the emergence of MAD. It included two unsub- stantiated notions: (1) that it is impossible to reliably hit a bullet with a bullet, and</p></li></ol></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">by incorporating multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs), decoys, and chaff, the offense will always have an overwhelm- ing edge over the defense. Both have been largely debunked. Miniaturized computer circuits, development of optimized (pro- portional navigation) guidance algorithms,</p></li></ol><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;">Marvin Baker Schaffer is an Adjunct Professional Staff Member at the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica,  California.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">European Phased Adaptive Approach, initi- ated by the Obama administration in 2009. It is a regional defense to protect both our</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">and redundant sensors mounted on speedy, high-acceleration interceptors have enabled consistent single-shot hit probabilities of 0.8</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to 0.95, implying 0.992 to 0.9999 levels for three independent shots. MIRV/decoy/chaff issues have been addressed by focusing</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on the boost phase of the ballistic missile trajectory, where all offensive elements are bundled together allowing a single hit to destroy the entire package. Admittedly, boost-phase intercept approaches are still works in progress and not adequately funded. There are promising concepts, however, and useful results should follow within a decade or so. Moreover, even if the necessary redundancy is not attained solely in the boost phase, backup by ground-based midcourse and terminal phase interceptors can be provided as necessary.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Perversely, the present political climate is not receptive to space-based weapons. If that changes, high-energy lasers and hit-to- kill interceptor constellations—both space- based—have potential. Brilliant Pebbles (dis- cussed below) with hit-to-kill components has exceptional merit for the boost phase as well as for midcourse. Unfortunately, it was discontinued by the Clinton administration for ideological reasons presumably rooted</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in reluctance to orbit weapons in space. However, if boost-phase attack is ultimately pursued (as it should be), the utilization</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of space constellations for missile defense merits additional review.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Solid-state lasers of 1,000 kW in low- Earth orbit also have potential. The key to their success is reducing vulnerability to antisatellite weapons using low-cost decoys.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Additionally, aircraft-mounted high- energy lasers warrant further consideration. Multiple-shot solid-state devices also operat- ing at 1,000 kW with standoff of 100 nautical miles (nm) have been postulated. That level of performance has already been demon- strated with chemical lasers but the launch platforms were bulky, vulnerable to air defenses, and generally unsuitable for mili- tary use. The transition to high-energy solid- state media is about 10 years in the future.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In what follows, the history of prior BMD is reviewed and the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) is then sum- marized. Our analysis sadly indicates that neither currently deployed stateside defenses nor EPAA offers robust prospects for reliable homeland protection. To set the stage for a dependable homeland defense, the funda- mental relationships between high-reliability protection and nuclear stockpile quantities are next expounded analytically. Issues con-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">cerning first strike stability in the context of MAD are also explored but subsequently dismissed as irrelevant. Finally, several new approaches are suggested for boost-phase</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">BMD as follow-on to EPAA. The expectation is that reliable missile defense can indeed be realized in the long term and, concurrently, nuclear stockpile quantities can go down further by substantial quantities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historical Context</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The original BMD program was authorized by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1957 and assigned to both the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. Army. It was ARPA’s largest program. When the “Defense” was added to ARPA to create DARPA in 1972, BMD continued as  a major research activity emphasizing high- energy lasers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Concurrently, the Army also under- took BMD development, initially extrapolat- ing from the Nike antiaircraft series. The first program was Sentinel, a two-tiered nuclear configuration containing intercep- tors operating both within and above the atmosphere. The endo-atmospheric inter- ceptor was the nuclear-tipped Sprint. Sup- ported by the Perimeter Acquisition Radar, it was able to filter out decoys and chaff. The exo-atmospheric interceptor called Spartan employed an X-ray kill mechanism pro- duced by its nuclear warhead. Guided by the Missile Site Radar, it was capable of destroy- ing several reentry vehicles simultaneously. However, critics maintained that the radars would not function adequately in an envi- ronment characterized by prior nuclear detonations and blackout. Ultimately, that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">flaw terminated the program.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In 1969, the Nixon administration changed both the name and the mission  of Sentinel. It became Safeguard and the mission was ballistic missile silo defense rather than city defense. Operational in 1975, Safeguard protected 150 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) deployed in North Dakota. However, it was deactivated after only a few months.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">America then became completely dependent on MAD and lacked an operational BMD system for the next three decades.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In the 1980s, the Reagan administra- tion refocused BMD under the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The 1972 Anti- Ballistic Missile Treaty had prohibited extensive BMD deployments but constraints</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">on research were ambiguous. SDI research, popularly known as “Star Wars,” was broad- based and pushed the limits of knowledge. Its principal elements were:</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Space-based X-ray Lasers. <span class="p">The initial focus of SDI was a nuclear explosion–initi- ated X-ray device. In theory, selected spectra would pump linked laser emitters on nearby satellites so that several incoming ballistic missiles could be targeted and destroyed simultaneously. In subsequent testing, however, nuclear-energized lasers proved unsuccessful.</span></p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Chemical Lasers. <span class="p">In 1985, a deuterium fluoride laser known as the Mid-Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser (MIRACL) was conceived. It successfully destroyed a Titan missile in a simulated boost-phase intercept and was the basis for several Army and</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Air Force follow-on programs. In 2009, a descendent of MIRACL shot down a boost- phase missile in actual flight as part of the Airborne Laser test schedule, and in 2010, it destroyed two rockets in quick succession. The Airborne Laser had a power of several megawatts and was capable of 100-nm stand- off. However, it required a large, vulnerable launch platform (of the Boeing 747 aircraft class) and was considered unacceptable by the Air Force. The Airborne Laser program was canceled in 2012 after 16 years of devel- opment and an expenditure of $5 billion.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Neutral Particle Beams. <span class="p">An ambitious neutral particle beam weapon for deployment in space was also explored. Neutral particle beams are streams of near light-speed atoms and neutrons emitted by highly energized accelerators and are capable of superheat-</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ing and catastrophically destroying massive target structures. Particle beam BMD weapons were eventually abandoned because practical space-based versions with the required energy and power were not realized.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">When the Soviet Union collapsed  and the Cold War ended, the focus of BMD changed. In 1991, SDI was recast as Global</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS). GPALS had three components collectively intended to provide robust protection against accidental or unauthorized attacks by Russia or China and limited attacks by rogue nations. They included a space-based defense against boost-phase missiles, a ground-based midcourse phase for home- land defense, and a ground-based terminal defense against theater threats. Its principal programs were:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Missile Defense Agency</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">Airborne Laser Test Bed final flight as it transitions to long-term storage in Arizona</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="697" height="343" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_131.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s59" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Brilliant Pebbles. <span class="p">Brilliant Pebbles  was a stand-alone space-based constellation of small interceptors primarily focused on boost-phase targets.

Costs were estimated at $1.1 million per interceptor or roughly $1.1 billion for</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a constellation of 1,000.<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61"> </span>Brilliant Pebbles<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61"> </span>achieved or defined a clear path to most of the GPALS objectives for boost-phase BMD. However, it was canceled both on budgetary grounds and on a reluctance even to put defensive weapons into space.</p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ground-based Midcourse Defense. <span class="p">GMD is a deployed BMD system to protect the U.S. homeland. Interceptors were emplaced in Alaska and California, total- ing 30 missiles by the end of 2010, with the objective of adding 14 more by 2017. Further plans to put missiles in Poland and radars  in the Czech Republic were subsequently canceled by the Obama administration.

THAAD employs an enhanced kinetic energy kill mechanism. Two batteries (48 missiles) were activated in Texas in 2008 and two additional batteries are planned for 2013. Some of these missiles will be deployed in Guam in response to North Korean threats. The launchers, together with eight missiles, are truck-mounted. Each missile weighs</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">900 kg, the range is greater than 200 km,  and the speed is 2.8 km/sec. Guided by the Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveil- lance (AN/TPY-2) X-band radar, THAAD is similar to the Patriot PAC-3 and is designed to hit with a small explosive warhead that enhances the kill. The U.S. Navy has a complementary sea-based system—the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System—that uses the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">New BMD Approaches</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In September 2009, the Obama admin- istration decided to cancel GMD deploy- ments planned for Poland and the Czech Republic and instead undertook the Euro- pean Phased Adaptive Approach. According to the National Research Council,<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61"> </span>EPAA is</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">specifically intended to protect European allies and deployed U.S. forces against an Iranian midcourse missile attack. It is not a defense against an attack by Russia or China.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">EPAA was planned in four phases to begin in 2011 and end after 2020. The deployment includes SM-3s with Blocks</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">IA/IB/IIA/IIB, in which velocities increase progressively from 3 to 5.5 km/sec and in which seeker optics are upgraded from</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">one-color to two-color. Initially, the system uses sea-based AN/SPY-1 and AN/TPY-2 radars, and the latter radar was deployed  in 2011 in Turkey. A total of 32 Aegis ships,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">each capable of tracking one hundred targets simultaneously, will be delivered along with 409 SM-3s. In 2015, some of those SM-3 interceptors will also be deployed on land in Romania, and possibly by 2018 in Poland. The United States will additionally develop the Airborne Infrared Sensor platforms capable of tracking hundreds of targets simultaneously.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The SM-3 Block IIB was scheduled to be deployed in Phase 4. The intent was to provide “limited” capability to counter bal- listic missiles in the boost phase. However,  a 2011 Defense Science Board study asserted that goal was unrealistic and Phase 4 was subsequently canceled in 2013.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A number of deployments in Phase 1 are currently in place to defend against first-gen- eration Iranian missile launches (that is, those that are not augmented with extensive MIRVs</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and decoys). Existing EPAA deployments are capable of effective midcourse engagements only until such time as Iran inevitably fields more capable countermeasures.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Several X-band radars oriented toward Iran are currently stationed in Turkey, the Negev Desert in Israel, and the Island of Qatar. Patriot PAC-3 Missiles are collocated with the radars. Standard Missiles on Aegis Missile Defense Ships are also deployed in both the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61"> </span>The deployment is such that bal- listic missile launches directed toward the Middle East or Europe can be detected and responded to with redundancy. The short- and medium-range missiles in Iran’s inven- tory have large radar cross-sections, and Standard Missiles deployed on Aegis ships and land-based Patriot PAC-3 Missiles have</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">a promising record for engaging such targets. They do not have enough range and speed to engage them in the boost phase, however.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Beyond ePAA</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A solid-state HEL mounted on an aircraft is a long-term alternative to EPAA and would be capable of multiple lethal shots from standoff distances of 100 nm. The required laser power is 1,000 kW. The currently achieved maximum power level is 105 kW, reached in 2009, with the Northrop Grumman Joint High Power Solid-State Laser (JHPSSL). JHPSSL leveraged seven</p><ol id="l37"><li style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">kW laser units synchronized to produce the total output. It is conceptually scalable to achieve even higher power.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A parallel effort is the High Energy Liquid Laser Area Defense System (HELLADS) being developed by General Atomics with sponsorship from DARPA. The goal is to synchronize three 50-kW lasers to produce a total output of 150 kW.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Note that neither JHPSSL nor HELLADS is intended to engage ballistic missile targets. They nevertheless are judged to be appropriate technology for scaling up to a usable antiballistic missile weapon.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">High-energy lasers can also be deployed from space. Solid-state devices of 1,000 kW are again envisioned. Target selection and acquisition would have to be provided by a space-based array such the Airborne Infrared Sensor configuration. Assuming only one laser will be involved, the engagement by necessity would be shoot-look-shoot. Space-based HELs have been investigated by DARPA for many</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">years but have not been realized as weapons because of their vulnerability to antisatellite weapons. Note, however, that survivability can be increased very substantially by embedding the HEL platform in a constel- lation of decoys. Improvements in invulner- ability by a factor of 10–100 can be achieved at modest cost.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">An HEL with capability against boost- phase ballistic missiles includes 10 100-kW lasers synchronized to produce a 1,000-kW output. The system includes an adaptive optics module to compensate for a turbulent atmosphere.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">A key technology for successful HELs involves dissipating large quantities of waste heat. Typically, a HEL has about a 10 percent thermal efficiency, so a 1,000-kW laser pro- duces 900 kW of waste power, the heat from which must be dealt with. ARPA is support- ing efforts to increase the HEL efficiency to 30 percent.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">As mentioned previously, one of the more promising approaches for providing multiple shots in the boost phase is Brilliant Pebbles. Brilliant Pebbles expends small, relatively inexpensive projectiles at moving targets. This encourages multiple defensive attempts either simultaneously or in quick shoot-look-shoot succession. Since the Bril- liant Pebbles projectiles are stand-alone with independent target acquisition and tracking, the multiple engagements should be statisti- cally independent.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">An additional boost-phase BMD initiative could be based on stealthy armed aerial drones. Target selection and acquisi- tion would be self-contained using passive infrared sensors. If the drones operated within roughly 50 nm of the launch site, they could attack large, initially slow- moving ballistic missiles with conventional air-to-air missiles using explosive war- heads. Drones of the MQ-9 Reaper class  are currently being considered for boost- phase target acquisition but not for attack. Reapers can stand off hundreds of nautical miles but they are not stealthy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Focus on the Boost Phase</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Reliable defenses for protection of the homeland are in disarray programmatically. Current and planned deployments do not deal with a sophisticated attack and focus only on the midcourse and terminal phases. Boost-phase defenses were developed to a significant level in the SDI and GPALS activ-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">ities. Although now dormant, they could be restored relatively quickly since the principal political constraint—the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty—has been removed.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The focus of an efficient defense should be in the boost phase because the MIRVs, decoys, and chaff are still bundled together, and a single energetic hit will destroy them all. If the attack is delayed until the mid- course or terminal phases, it will be neces- sary to engage numerous entities for reliable operations. Currently deployed defenses deal only with midcourse and terminal threats.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Analytical Modeling</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Arms limitation agreements between the United States and Soviet Union/Russian Federation have reduced respective strategic nuclear stockpiles substantially: from 10,000 to 6,000, from 6,000 to 3,500, and then to 2,200. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty negotiations, which reduce levels to 1,500–1,675, have recently been completed and ratified by the U.S. Senate. These smaller stockpiles help to enable effective missile defense. This can be shown analytically by calculating surviving strategic reentry vehi- cles as a function of the number of attackers and the effectiveness of the defense.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Attacks varying from 10,000 to 10 are of interest. Missile defense consists of three independent attempts against each threat since individual missile defense effectiveness is not perfect and varies from 80–95 percent. The significant finding is that surviving warheads are substantially less than 1 if</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the defense effectiveness is 95 percent for attacks of 1,000, and also for attacks of 100 at effectiveness levels of 80–90 percent.<span class="s60">6</span><span class="s61"> </span>It is not unreasonable to anticipate opposing</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">stockpiles of 1,000 and defense effectiveness at 95 percent within a decade or so.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Strategic and First Strike Stability</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The implications of both strategic stability<span class="s60">7</span><span class="s61"> </span>and first strike stability<span class="s60">8</span><span class="s61"> </span>have been studied intensively.

Brilliant Pebbles, standoff and space deployed high-energy lasers, and stealthy drones armed with air-to-air missiles are all promising approaches for achieving such a boost-phase capability.

During the height of the Cold War, BMD was con- sidered by both the Soviet Union and the United States to be highly destabilizing; that is, the Russians maintained that construc- tion of missile defenses would negate their nuclear deterrent encouraging a first strike even before the program was complete.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The United States agreed. To mitigate that danger, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was negotiated and ratified by both sides. However, nuclear arms limitation in the last two decades has largely eliminated those concerns, at least on the part of the United States, and the 1972 treaty has since been nullified.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">In the past several decades, nuclear stockpiles on both sides have decreased substantially. <i>Analysts agree that as opposing stockpiles approach 1,000, first strike stabil- ity becomes insensitive to missile defenses. </i>This follows because at reduced stockpile levels a large fraction of the U.S. capability  is on submarines and bombers, and both are substantially invulnerable to a first strike.

It has survived mistaken strategic barriers including a treaty that perpetuated MAD, and the notion that BMD promoted first strike instability. It has also faced political hurdles that constrained the use of space</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">for weaponry, even defensive weaponry.

That changed in 1918. Ludendorff ultimately failed as a strategic leader because of a fundamentally flawed vision of strategy in which means became ends, and Clausewitz’s great dictum—that war is a continuation of politics by other means—was turned on its head.<span class="s60">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Checked at the Marne in 1914, the German army remained on the strategic defensive on the Western Front while British and French armies periodically attempted  to push the Germans out of France.<span class="s60">8</span><span class="s61"> </span>Both sides were locked in a war of attrition along a “continuous line of trenches, 475 miles long,”<span class="s60">9</span><span class="s61"> </span>from the Flemish coast to the Swiss border. After over 3 years of sanguinary stalemate, 1918 dawned with new risks and opportunities for the German Supreme Command owing to three significant events in the previous year: the entry of the United States into the war as a result of the 1917 German unrestricted submarine campaign, increasing hardship in Germany as a result of the British naval blockade, and Russia’s exit from the war as a result of the Bolshevik coup d’état.<span class="s60">10</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The first two of these events increased pressure on Germany to bring the conflict</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to a rapid end. The blockade was strangling Germany and undermining morale on the home front, as reflected in a violently sup- pressed labor strike in January 1918.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">1 </span>The United States provided the Allies with an untapped source of manpower that Germany could not hope to match. Against these chal- lenges, the collapse of Russia freed resources from the Eastern Front, permitting Germany to bring new strength—over 50 first class divisions—to bear in the West. Berlin could eclipse Allied strength, if only slightly, and only until American forces began arriving.<span class="s60">12</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">There was one other development that more than anything else drove Ludendorff’s strategic calculus in 1918: the development of new infantry “storm” tactics. Tested in the East at Riga in 1917, these tactics relied on speedy infiltration of enemy positions by bypassing centers of resistance to achieve deep penetrations for follow-on exploitation while leaving strong points for mop-up by subsequent waves of infantry.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">3 </span>These tactics were Ludendorff’s solution to cracking the Allied front, reintroducing a war of move- ment and compelling a decisive battle on the Western Front.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Once Ludendorff was committed to an attack, the next decision was where to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">attack. He consulted the chiefs of staff of the army corps involved. One advocated attack- ing the French at Verdun while another urged attacking the British in Flanders.<span class="s60">14</span><span class="s61"> </span>Ludendorff himself favored an attack on the British near St. Quentin, where the British and French armies joined.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">5 </span>Ultimately the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">mendous cost—what Churchill termed “the price of the offensive”<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">8</span>—and to no strategic effect.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61">9 </span>Each attack followed a recurring pattern as casualties, exhaustion, stiffening resistance, and what Clausewitz termed “friction”<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">0 </span>robbed it of its impetus. Each penetration weakened subsequent attacks by drawing in German reserves to defend an extended front in a newly created salient, in hastily constructed positions generally facing Allied fire from three sides.<span class="s60">21</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Another pattern that repeated itself in the Ludendorff offensives was emblematic of Ludendorff ’s weakness as a strategist. He allowed tactical developments to undermine his operational design. In the <i>Michael </i>offen- sive, the main effort was to be in the north, but that was where the resistance was great- est. So Ludendorff reinforced the support- ing effort in the south, where more progress was made. This “tactical bias” resulted</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in changing the direction of the attack to exploit tactical success<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">2 </span>and more criti- cally to changing the objective. The initial objective was to turn the British flank and drive northwest to the sea, but this shifted to an effort to split the British and French armies. Instead of one massive thrust, there would be three lesser thrusts (and paid for with reserves intended for what became</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the <i>Georgette </i>attack).<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">3 </span>Ludendorff was “reacting to events, following the line of least resistance, rather than dominating and determining the outcome.”<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">4 </span>The tactical directive became the strategic goal, and Ludendorff ’s lack of clarity led to a general</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="688" height="19" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_136.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">pressing forward by successful elements.<span class="s60">25</span><span class="s61"> </span>This begged the question, <i>pressing forward to what? </i>“The absence of an answer exposed the emptiness of the <i>Michael </i>operation after the first day’s failure on the right.”<span class="s60">26</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ludendorff fell into the same trap in the <i>Blücher </i>attack, originally intended as a diversion against the French to draw in Allied reserves preparatory to an attack against the British in Flanders.<span class="s60">27</span><span class="s61"> </span>As with <i>Michael</i>, spectacular early success (Paris beckoned) caused a shift in Ludendorff ’s</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">objective and a diversionary attack became the German main effort until it, too, stalled:<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">8 </span>“Outwardly all seemed to be going well. Actually all had miscarried.”<span class="s60">2</span><span class="s61">9 </span>Two more offenses, <i>Gneisenau </i>and <i>Frieden- sturm</i>, were attempted, but neither offered any real hope of victory. One German</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">staff officer remarked after <i>Blücher</i>, “The Supreme Command renounced further plans for decisive battle, and made other diversive [<i>sic</i>] offenses in the hope of something turning up.”<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Nothing did, and the butcher’s bill was more than Germany could pay. In 6 months, the German army was 900,000 men smaller, even as American forces began to swell the Allied ranks. The balance of force, and the initiative, shifted irretrievably to the Allies.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Much could be written about Luden- dorff ’s persistently erroneous assumptions in 1918: that Germany had the means—in the trenches of 1918—to achieve the decisive battle that eluded them in the open terrain of 1914; that the BEF, and not the French army, was the Allied center of gravity; that the defeat of the BEF in France would knock England out of the war; and so on. But analyzing these errors is beside the point; whatever his failures to test or retest the assumptions that informed his operational concepts, Ludendorff did not adhere to those concepts long enough for his assump- tions to matter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Failure to Define a Purpose</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ludendorff had deduced that “tactics had to be considered before purely strategi- cal [<i>sic</i>] objects which it is futile to pursue unless tactical success is possible.”<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">1 </span>This</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is reasonable. Feasibility of any course of action is a fundamental consideration. But Ludendorff went much further—or rather, did not go anywhere at all—by substitut- ing tactical considerations (means) for strategic objectives (ends). His “innova-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">tive techniques were largely invalidated by the inability to define a purpose for the campaign.”<span class="s60">32</span><span class="s61"> </span>If there is any validity to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Clausewitz’s theory of strategy and strategic leadership,<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">3 </span>then Ludendorff ’s approach could not be further from the ideal.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Starting from political considerations, the strategist must “define an aim for the operational side of the war that will be in accordance with its purpose.”<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">4 </span>Then, in exercising leadership, the strategist with “great strength of character” and “firmness of mind” follows through steadily and is not “thrown off course by thousands of diver- sions.”<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">5 </span>Put another way, strategy assigns  an aim to an operation, which is nothing more than a means to obtain that aim.<span class="s60">36</span><span class="s61"> </span>With the 1918 offensives, the objective was not so much lost as never given any primacy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ludendorff’s own summary of his concept of operations reads as a rejection of Clausewitz: “We will punch a hole. . . . For the rest, we shall see.”<span class="s60">3</span><span class="s61">7 </span>This “was not strategy. It was more like an act of faith . . . a blind hope that something, somehow, would turn up.”<span class="s60">38</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Churchill wrote, “That the decision was disastrous has been proved by the event. But it may also be contended that it was wrong.”<span class="s60">39</span><span class="s61"> </span>The offensives failed and the question becomes whether there was an alternative given the strategic situation in early 1918. Certainly there were voices within Germany in favor of peace. Chancellor Georg von Hertling wanted to be the “reconciliation chancellor,”<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">0 </span>and elements in the Reichstag advocated outreach by making a commit- ment to the territorial integrity of Belgium.<span class="s60">41</span><span class="s61"> </span>The Russian collapse and German territorial gains in the East offered potential bargaining chips.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">2 </span>It was not to be. Ludendorff was bent on keeping German conquests in the East <i>and </i>the West, most problematically (for the peacemakers) parts of France and Belgium.<span class="s60">43</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">This was incredibly naïve considering Belgium was the reason England entered the war in the first place. This thinking reveals a still greater failing as a strategist: Luden- dorff’s inability to understand the political object of the conflict and to subordinate his military strategy to it. Whatever Germany had gone to war for in 1914, it was not the conquest of Belgium or the annexation</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of the French coal fields. By 1918, the war had become about national survival, a fact Ludendorff appears to have recognized<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">4 </span>but to which he appears to have applied no con- sidered analysis.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Similarly, once begun, the offensives did not have to be all or nothing. General Max Hoffmann, formerly Ludendorff’s top staff officer in the East, noted that the “first attempt [<i>Michael</i>], undertaken with all the means at our disposal, had failed, so it was certain . . . that further attacks undertaken with diminishing resources could not hope for success. On the day Ludendorff broke off the first offensive before Amiens, it would have been his duty to draw the atten- tion of the Government to the desirability of opening peace negotiations.”<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">5 </span>But this,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">again, required a focus on the political objec- tive of the conflict, which was something Ludendorff could not see in realistic terms.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">At that point Germany still had some means and some hope of resistance. The blockade held, but perhaps the Eastern conquests could be organized to Germany’s economic advantage. Perhaps the lift in morale that American forces provided<span class="s60">46</span><span class="s61"> </span>could be blunted as the Americans bloodied themselves against a German line defended in depth by elite divisions. Perhaps, too,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the enthusiasm of the Alliance to continue the war could be diminished by a political program that stated Germany had no territo- rial aims in the West and would “prejudice  in no way the freedom and honor of other peoples.”<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">7 </span>Ludendorff was blind to such alternative courses of action, which were better suited to political realities and the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">actual strategic context, because of his hyper- focus on the means at his disposal: innova- tive offensive infantry tactics and a mass of fresh divisions. They were on hand. They must be used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Confusing Means with Ends</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">There is more to war than warfare and there is more to strategy than military strat- egy.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">8 </span>A strategist must understand context, the nature of the threat, and its relationship to the national interest.<span class="s60">4</span><span class="s61">9 </span>Given the context  of 1918, the question facing Ludendorff was <i>how to ensure national survival</i>. A “marginal- utility calculus of violence,” what Michael Geyer terms an “idealistic strategy,” would have “counseled the limitation and scaling down of goals in an increasingly desperate military situation.”<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">0 </span>Ludendorff was consti- tutionally unable to do that. “In Ludendorff was found a hardy gambler incapable of withdrawing from the game while he still had stakes to play.”<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">1 </span>In his mind, “supreme hazards exercised an evident fascination.”<span class="s60">52</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">On a fundamental level, to Ludendorff, the war itself became the end, or what Clause- witz called a “complete, untrammeled, abso- lute manifestation of violence” that usurped policy.<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">3 </span>There were clear alternatives to a fight to the death, but Ludendorff could not conceive of them.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ludendorff provides a cautionary tale for today’s strategists in two respects. Strate- gists must avoid confusing means with ends. This temptation remains relevant in an era  of nation-building as a response to a terrorist attack, in an era of new (or renewed) con- cepts such as Air-Sea Battle or counterinsur- gency operations. “Securing the populace,” however laudable as a humanitarian ideal, is at core a <i>means </i>to starve an insurgent group of indigenous support, not an <i>end </i>in itself. Other means to the same end may be as effective, or more effective, depending on the context. In this respect, the debate over the Afghan surge is a positive counterexample.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">It arguably forced a reconsideration of ends from successful application of doctrinal counterinsurgency tactics itself<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">4 </span>to the underlying national security objectives these tactics were a means to address.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Perhaps more important, an exami- nation of the Ludendorff offensives offers insights into the proper relationship between national leaders and the techni- cal experts who advise them. “Ludendorff is an outstanding lesson in the dangers of the expert who has so concentrated on his own department that he is unable to see the part in relation to the whole.”<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">5 </span>Because he could see only the military instrument, and saw politics as something that served war,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Ludendorff’s war plans were not strategy but rather the inversion of strategy. They were not crafted in service of a political goal other than victory at any price, without any real thought as to what interest that victory might serve. “The first casualty of this insistence was strategy as the principled analysis of war.”<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">6 </span>In strategy, means should be subordi- nated to ends, and war to policy. Ludendorff managed to “turn this calculus on its head.”<span class="s60">57</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">When the conduct of war is turned over to technologists or engineers, to “opera- tionists”<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">8 </span>like Ludendorff, divorced from the larger political context, from the purpose for which the instrument of war is used, there is danger. There is danger that war aims—cast adrift from political objectives—will become “radical and encompassing” with goals “subordinated to the mobilization of means,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="217" height="20" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_137.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">independent of the actual military use-value of each new increment of force.”<span class="s60">5</span><span class="s61">9 </span>In such an environment, lives are thrown away, nations are exhausted, and war progresses to the natural, maximum, unrestrained level pos- tulated by Clausewitz. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">N O T E S</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l39"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">See, for example, Rajiv Chandrasekaran, <i>Little America: The War with the War for Afghanistan </i>(New York: Knopf, 2012); Bob Woodward, <i>Obama’s Wars </i>(New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010).</p></li><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><p class="s11" style="display: inline;">See, for example, Colin S.

Composed of personnel from various U.S. Government agencies and the military, these teams are among the most important units on the ground. They function in direct support</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of American and North Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives and are critical for building and sustaining effective gover- nance. As a key member of the team—with the attending corruption, infighting, pitiful resources, and lack cultural intelligence  and understanding he and the PRT faced  on the ground—Green’s story reflects the challenges faced by the United States and its allies in Afghanistan.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The author, currently a fellow at the Institute for Near East Policy in Washing- ton, DC, has extensive experience in the war on terror including tours in Afghanistan and Iraq in both military and civilian capacities. This no doubt informs his central premise and stated purpose for writing: to highlight senior leadership failures which have under- mined the sacrifice and faithful efforts of Americans on the ground trying to carry out national policy in Afghanistan (Epilogue).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Green’s journey to Uruzgan Province began in the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, where he was working in the Office of the Secretary of Defense when Flight 93 struck the building. Like many Americans</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in the early days of the war on terror, he was driven to participate as meaningfully as he could. His commitment led him to the State Department and the Uruzgan PRT in Tarin Khowt, where he learned the realities of counterinsurgency warfare in a short time. His experiences are a microcosm of U.S. efforts to create a Western-style democracy among people traditionally resistant to central authority.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Green’s work is at once a personal memoir and a war story. As such, it often highlights PRT activities in which he was personally involved including civil-military operations, psychological operations, the 2005 Afghan national elections, and other development and governance initiatives throughout Uruzgan Province. Yet there</p><p class="s192" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Center for Technology and National Security Policy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s193" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Defense Horizons 76</p><p class="s194" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sharing to Succeed: Lessons from Open Information-sharing Projects in Afghanistan</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By Linton Wells II, James Bosworth, John Crowley, and Rebecca Linder Blachly</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Unless U.S. and coalition forces can share information with the populations they seek to influence in complex civil-military opera- tions, they cannot achieve the goals for which they were committed. Information, com- munications, and related support structures influence all aspects of complex operations and need to be treated as critical infrastruc- tures and essential services but rarely are.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Open information-sharing projects require sustained leadership interest plus shared and stable priorities among many parties. Absent this emphasis, the authors argue, changes in personnel, mission priorities, and funding levels will make it hard to develop, transi- tion, and sustain any such effort. Observa- tions from information-sharing projects in Afghanistan suggest several ways to change behaviors that can turn lessons observed thus far into lessons actually learned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s195" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">Visit the NDU Press Web site</p><p class="s195" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: center;">for more information on publications at  ndupress.ndu.edu</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="989" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_139.png"/></span></p><p class="s186" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">BOOK REVIEWS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">is no explanation of how these capabilities were synchronized and applied, or how his experiences are tied to the greater mission.

Green describes these events in close detail, giving readers a glimpse into the difficult and austere challenges associ- ated with American nation-building efforts in Afghanistan. As a memoir, Green’s tale is rich; he captures the exotic and desolate beauty of Afghanistan and relates the com- plexities of its people as only one who has been there can.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Yet lost in descriptions of the wilds of Uruzgan and the corrupt dealings of color- ful Afghan police chiefs and tribal warlords are the lessons Green intends to convey. <i>The Valley’s Edge </i>is a cautionary tale of 21<span class="s60">s</span><span class="s61">t</span>- century warfare gone wrong on the fringes of the American empire. Indeed, there is an</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">air of criticism running through the book as leitmotif, calling into question the practices and methods of activities, headquarters, and individuals who may have displeased Green during his time in Afghanistan (9, 143). Sections are prefaced by quotations from famous counterinsurgency theoreticians, ostensibly to indicate lessons the United States and its senior leadership have failed  to heed.

Here, he focuses on ways to reduce the costs of defense in order to achieve established strategy rather than presenting any revolutionary changes to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">U.S. strategy itself. He presents the deficit  as one of the greatest challenges to national security, arguing that there are ways to cut another $200 billion in the next decade beyond the Obama administration’s current baseline reduction of $350 billion. Readers grappling with the difficulty of sustaining a</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">“preeminent” military with reduced funding will be rewarded with challenges to the status quo and insightful ideas as the United States moves beyond the previous decade’s military growth. Yet the planned military</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">framework for future force structure. While</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">O’Hanlon acknowledges short-term security challenges in the Middle East, South Asia, and Northeast Asia, he argues that the United States must uphold the long view in strengthening its nonmilitary foundations to maintain enduring power. He also provides broad ideas that hold considerable merit, such as the need for allies to contribute</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">more to not only their own security, but to regional and global security as well. None- theless, the reader must judge if his views  of the security environment are satisfactory and the accompanying force structure rec- ommendations are adequate.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Chapter two proposes a future ground force structure for the Army and Marine Corps that is much smaller than today since the assumption is that the United States  will not engage in protracted land wars of the kind recently experienced in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of the $200 billion in total savings that O’Hanlon argues is plausible, land forces account for the largest single savings component at $80 billion. He states</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">that the United States can maintain the same combat capability through reductions in Active-duty Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and Marine Infantry Regiments by shifting some BCTs to the National Guard. This would sufficiently support his “1 + 2” construct while providing for a base force that could expand if necessary. It is worth noting here that the “1 + 2” construct is somewhat a hybrid of previous studies</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">from the last 25 years, such as the Bottom Up Review strategy of winning two major regional conflicts. However, O’Hanlon’s idea is less ambitious, calling for the United States to be able to fight “one war plus two missions,” the latter effort characterized</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">by stabilization and peace-keeping like the drawdown efforts in Afghanistan.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Chapter three highlights operations in the Asia-Pacific where the Navy and Air Force are expected to be the leading</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Services, as evident by the emergence of Air Sea Battle.

No single model for transitional justice exists; in the course of confronting, overcoming, and recovering from serious domestic upheaval and conflict, a substantial number of countries have employed various means to achieve transitional justice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Syria can help itself by quickly choosing a model for transitional justice that is consis- tent with its national culture and that meets the standards expected of such efforts with respect to due process and transparency. Such an effort may facilitate national healing and reconstruction and allow warring parties to find common ground. If delayed, transitional justice may be irreparably supplanted by the wholly destructive desire for private or com- munal vengeance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s195" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">Visit the NDU Press Web site</p><p class="s195" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: center;">for more information on publications at  ndupress.ndu.edu</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">countries have a vote in how U.S. forces</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">operate from their soil, he assures readers that a smaller carrier force would compen- sate for such constraints. He takes aim at the F-35 program, too, stating that advances in precision weaponry enable a smaller number of F-35s to be purchased than currently programmed. In terms of the surface and subsurface fleet, he advocates “sea swap- ping,” where ships and attack submarines would utilize dual crews to maintain a longer forward presence. This concept is in use today with the Navy’s ballistic missile submarines.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Chapters four and five discuss mod- ernization, nuclear weapons, missile defense, and intelligence. O’Hanlon prudently cautions against taking another “procure- ment holiday” that characterized military budgets in the 1990s, reminding readers that the Reagan buildup of the 1980s enabled American success since 2001. Further victory resides with fully funding acquisition but revising it with new notions such as count- ing Air Force and future Navy unmanned aerial vehicles as fighter jets. These actions could permit substantial decreases in the planned purchase of nearly 2,500 F-35s with a program cost of $300 billion. He also urges further reductions in nuclear weapons below the current Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty agreement of 1,550 strategic nuclear war- heads by retiring intercontinental ballistic missiles and refurbishing existing ballistic missile submarines. The rationale for these cuts is the belief that the United States will not fight a war with Russia and thus only needs to maintain a sufficient nuclear force to deter Moscow and Beijing.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The final chapter covers military com- pensation and Pentagon reforms. O’Hanlon advances several ideas such as reforming retirement to include IRA-like contributions for members serving less than 20 years, halting future increases in military pay, and increasing members’ sharing of health-care costs. Throughout this chapter, he makes  the overused comparison of the military and civilian sector, forgetting that the military members’ sworn oath to make the ultimate sacrifice is a fundamental and often over- looked distinction between the groups.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">contends that his force posture recommen-</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">dation is flexible enough to respond to a changing future, military minds will likely struggle with that point. After all, the need to plan for the worst-case scenario creates dissonance in the ability to think realisti- cally about the plausibility of the worst-case threat. While some readers may dispense with some of the recommendations, it would be irrational to discard them all. In the end, it is imperative that America preserves its military preeminence while at the same time being mindful of the new reality of shrink- ing defense budgets. This is where O’Hanlon gives readers a lot to contemplate. <span class="s52">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;">Lieutenant Colonel John R.

Additionally,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">while we leverage new technology to advance our science of control, that aspect may not always be robust (for instance, in austere envi- ronments) and may be vulnerable to attack. This further reinforces the need to focus on mission command.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Mission command is a command phi- losophy, as noted in the <i>Capstone Concept for Joint Operations: Joint Force 2020 </i>(CCJO). The key attributes of this command philosophy (trust, understanding, and intent) are in current joint and Service doctrines. All com- manders exercise varying degrees of control in their application of mission command based on several factors, such as the situation, activ- ity, and capabilities of forces.<span class="s60">1</span><span class="s61"> </span>One example</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of this is the positive and procedural control measures used within airspace control.<span class="s60">2</span></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A mission command philosophy allows</p><p class="s57" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;">Colonel James Parrington, USMC, is Chief of the Deployable Training Division (DTD), Joint Staff J7, Joint Training.

The Navy’s daily intentions messages and Composite Warfare Commander Concept and the Air Force’s centralized control and decentralized execution concept for command and control are Service examples. Mission command provides the means (through commander’s intent, mission type orders, and decentral- ized execution) to operate at the speed of the problem by increasing overall agility and effectiveness, and enables better synergistic cross-domain operations with our joint, inter- agency, and multinational mission partners. We have seen the following challenges in the exercise of mission command.</p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Understanding <span class="p">the many perspectives, interests, and policies at national and inter- national levels is hard for the commander and staff to digest. It is difficult to remain abreast of the continually changing geopo- litical context and national guidance due</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to its scope, complexity, and many players. (For example, in 2011, the mission in Libya rapidly evolved from one initially focused on noncombatant evacuation to that of military intervention). It is equally hard to rapidly share this changing understanding at every echelon in the military formation to enable disciplined initiative. Subordinates may not always grasp the subtleties of the broader and changing context in which they operate. This can result in the commanders opting to retain control and not empower their subordinates, potentially losing the initiative.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The decentralized nature of mission command and delegation of approval levels require that subordinate commanders under- stand and appreciate the many relevant laws, policies, and directives. Lack of a shared understanding of these <i>authorities </i>and their limitations can result in loss of legitimacy, trust, cohesion, and tendency to retain cen- tralized control.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Establishing and maintaining a common and uniform understanding of authorities become especially relevant in oper- ationalizing a mission command philosophy. There are numerous U.S. authorities (Titles  10, 22, 50, and others) and significant inter- national and national authorities (including the host nation) in multinational operations. There are also many specified authorities and responsibilities within the U.S. Armed Forces (such as the operational direction authority of a joint force commander and Services’ Title 10 and administrative control responsibilities).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">An example of this lies in the complex admin- istrative control and Title 10 relationships  that the U.S. National Support Element in</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Afghanistan has with the theater Service com- ponent commands (such as Army Central) and the Service forces under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization operational control of the commander of the International Security Assistance Force. Understanding and application of these many authorities require frequent special staff access to the commander as he frames problems, provides guidance,  and makes decisions.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The global <i>information environment </i>brings several challenges. It leads to an increase in the tempo of operations as we are challenged to observe, plan, decide, and act quicker than the adversary. It can also lead to instances of information overload as com- manders attempt to process all information before making decisions. In some cases, we</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">see that this onslaught of information—driven by the staff—may preclude commanders from taking valuable time to reflect on the problem, develop an operational approach, and craft clear guidance and intent. In these cases,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the commands often default to a centralized control philosophy as they react to emerg- ing challenges with no clear overarching approach.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Staffs may also be inclined to rely too much on the science of control relative to the art of command by implementing more reporting, control measures, and battle</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">rhythm events in an attempt to fully monitor, track, and control operations. Staffs may not understand or be comfortable in operating within a mission command construct of trust, shared understanding, intent, and empower- ment. Likewise, the opposite may also exist where the staff may have to operate in an envi- ronment where shared understanding and trust are inadequate at the command level.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The information environment also  has the potential to imbue tactical action with near immediate strategic ramifications due to visibility in the continuous 24-hour media. This <i>could </i>lead to risk adverseness and a tendency to overcontrol and centralize</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">decisionmaking when we may need to do just the opposite.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Successful units fight through this by working even harder to share understanding; provide clear intent; and trust, decentralize, and empower subordinates to appropriately act at the speed of the problem. We also</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">see commanders using their instincts and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">intuitive judgments to cut through the fog and friction induced within the information environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The interconnected nature of operations requires continuous interaction with a <i>large number of our unified action mission partners </i>especially at the strategic and operational levels. Building and maintaining trust with these many partners are difficult and impose significant time demands on commanders and staffs. This has particular significance to flag and general officers as they assume posi- tions of authority in strategic and operational level positions and spend significant time engaging with these partners. They will not have as much time available to control or guide subordinates as they may have done</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">in previous assignments. Thus, the concept of mission command and the importance of shared understanding, guidance, and intent may be even more important at this higher level as commanders increase efforts up and out with other mission partners. Nurturing</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">relationships must be a constant drumbeat for the commander—in and out of crises.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Our mission partners—both adjacent partners and subordinates—may come from <i>diverse cultures or backgrounds </i>in which decisionmaking is centralized, and where empowerment, subordinate-level decision- making, and acceptance of responsibility are not wanted or expected. Some mission partners may not have the capability to gain</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the same degree of situational understanding or have the same experience in operations (for example, a new U.S. or coalition member to the team) and may require increased support, supervision, or control. Equally important is understanding how each partner communi- cates. Some partners may use texting on cell phones, some need formal papers, some use fax, some prefer phone, and some require a formal top-down approach. Each partner has a method of communicating that is unique, and commanders must devote the time neces- sary to figure this out or they will waste time with ineffective communication that slows down the building of trust and confidence across the team. Commanders must recognize these differences as they build relationships, and massage and tailor the necessary level of coordination, control, or supervision. Ignor- ing these differences can damage trust and teamwork, and risk mission accomplishment.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">The decade of learned lessons in irregular warfare informs us of the value of decentralization to achieve operational objec-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="989" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_144.png"/></span></p><p class="s199" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Parrington and Findlay</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">tives and is the basis for globally integrated operations described in the CCJO. History suggests there is potential for <i>a return to more centralized command philosophies </i>as the mili- tary transitions from large-scale conflicts to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">a different landscape characterized by peace- time engagements and limited conflicts. Gar- rison operations, tight fiscal constraints, and increased competition for promotion could bias leaders, especially within the Services, toward centralization in an effort to be more efficient and controlling. Our joint headquar- ters may also be tempted to centrally control the myriad of more scrutinized peacetime engagements. However, while centralization may work to some degree in peace, it may</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">not work in conflict (or a disaster response) in which higher commanders rely on sub- ordinates’ initiatives and speed of decision and action. It takes time to develop a culture of decentralization and empowerment; it cannot occur overnight when a crisis occurs. Therefore, we suggest the need to deliberately determine the degree of a centralized or decentralized command climate and culture in peacetime.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">History also suggests the potential to <i>return to a Service-centric focus </i>in the years ahead as we move away from the decade of war and close interaction. Over time, we may forget the potential benefits of a unified action approach as we focus on Service basic skill sets. We may also lose the valuable tactics, techniques, and procedures relevant to joint and combined operations with our mission partners. This could move us away from a mission command philosophy and interde- pendent mindset with our partners that are essential for success in periods of conflict and other operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Insights</p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Building and maintaining trust <span class="p">is pos- sibly a commander’s most important action to establish and exercise mission command and to achieve cross-domain synergy.

This</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">can affect what “right looks like.” National leadership may have different geopolitical perspectives than field commanders. A theater-strategic commander might have a different perspective on the environment and problem than an individual at the tacti- cal level. Similarly, a military commander may have a different perspective than a State Department Foreign Service officer. Thus, the right thing for one may not be the same right thing for another. This also has  a temporal aspect to it: the environment is continually changing and the understand- ing of what is right may not keep up (for example, the changes in nighttime tactical</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">operations and evidence-based operations in Afghanistan as the government matured and asserted its sovereign authority).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">We observe that one must continually dialogue with higher authorities and mission partners to better understand the changing environment and perspectives and what a shared understanding of right looks like. This continuing dialogue deepens trust, clarifies authorities for action, assists problem-framing as part of design, enriches guidance and intent, enables synergy with mission part- ners, and, coupled with mission-type orders, enables us to release the disciplined initiative of subordinates to do the right thing. One combatant commander notes, “collaboration releases the initiative of subordinates.” This collaboration and information-sharing has significant time implications for joint force commanders and subordinates. There are a number of observed best practices:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Recognize the geopolitical challenges that national-level leaders will likely face in a crisis.

Sample  interpretation before issuing is often helpful. What the com- mander writes and what subordinates read may be different—better to fix this before sending.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Personally craft commander’s intent. We recognize this is a common dictum, but we still see planners drafting intent. These draft  intents  often  predispose  commander’s final intent and guidance documents and  do not reap the benefit of the commander’s personal reflections on the problem and approach.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Continuously share intent not only in orders but also during circulation, and in meetings and other battle rhythm events.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Be prepared to change intent based on the situation and reframing of the problem.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Do not abrogate the higher headquar- ters design and planning responsibilities as part of the concept of decentralization.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Providing risk guidance <span class="p">is an important aspect of mission command.

This is directly related to empowerment. There are a number of observed best practices:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Deliberately analyze risks to the mission and force.

Publicly outlining risk before under- standing national caveats creates the possibil- ity of placing team members in embarrassing positions (since they may not have the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">authority to decide what they can or cannot do in an operation).</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Delineate these risks to the mission and the force together with risk-mitigation direction  (including  decision  approval authorities).</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Be clear where the commander is willing to accept risk.

Those who did not appropri- ately decentralize lost agility and initiative, and risked mission failure. We have seen how commander’s intent—focused on the <i>what </i>and <i>why </i>versus the <i>how</i>—enables the disciplined initiative in subordinates to gain agility and effectiveness.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Commanders need to take the time to understand, recognize, and develop a subor- dinate’s ability for empowerment and initia- tive, together with the skill to know how and when to adjust the necessary level of super- vision. Consider how some commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan focused their attention and coaching on a new member of the team, developing his or her tactical prowess until up to standard, and then incrementally empowered them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">Combatant commands also recognize the need for empowerment. Every geographic combatant command we visit has numerous ongoing missions, including multiple peace- time engagements as they work with many</p><ol id="l43"><ol id="l44"><li style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Ambassadors, nations, and stakehold- ers throughout their area of responsibility. Similarly, functional combatant commands are working with all of the geographic com- mands. Each relies on mission command</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">to set conditions for numerous subordinate actions. These higher headquarters focus on design and planning activities and share their understanding and provide guidance and intent to help set conditions for their</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">subordinates to execute. There are a number of observed best practices:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Recognize the need not only for</span></p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">intent<span class="p">, but also for a </span>shared understanding</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="805" height="989" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_146.png"/></span></p><p class="s199" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Parrington and Findlay</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">of <i>context </i>in order to empower disciplined initiative—particularly important at the stra- tegic and operational levels. This is related to the earlier discussion on disciplined initiative.</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Delegate authorities to the lowest appropriate level capable of integrating assets to work inside the adversary’s decision cycle. Within this context, balance decentraliza- tion with the need for the requisite level of supervision.  Accept  becoming  uncomfortably decentralized to achieve mission success. This may include providing assets to subordinates as well.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Develop terms of reference docu- ments that lay out roles and responsibilities of deputy commanders and key staff within the headquarters.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Tailor decision approval matrices applicable to  decision  approval  authorities both within the headquarters and for sub- ordinate  headquarters.  For  example,  J-code directors may be empowered with certain decision authorities to maintain agility</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">and effectiveness within the headquarters in addition to empowering subordinate commanders.</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Align CCIR and other reporting requirements  with  decision-approval  levels. While recognizing the requirement for shared understanding,  guard  against  establishing CCIR and other reporting requirements that may impinge on the initiative or slow agility of subordinate units.</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Conduct quality in-briefs with new leaders/key  personnel  coupled  with  focused visits and circulation to assess strengths, degree of experience, and comfort in exercis- ing initiative  and accepting responsibility. Make subsequent decisions on necessary coaching, mentoring, and tailoring of degree of empowerment. (Some members of the team may be empowered more than others based on varying levels in their abilities, pro- pensity for initiative, and mission set.)</span></p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Be attentive not to overwhelm subor- dinates with collaboration or visits as they are also planning and conducting their missions with their subordinates. We often see deliber- ate limiting of demands on subordinates for extensive  updates  during  higher  headquarters battle rhythm updates, rather than tasking  the higher headquarters staff to report on</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">the situation, and then giving subordinates freedom to surface issues and questions.</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Define the fight. Ask the key ques- tions: What is the combatant command’s fight, the JTF’s fight, and the subordinate’s</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">fight? If we do not do this upfront, everyone focuses on fighting the subordinate’s fight; no one is focused on setting the conditions upfront for their success.</p><p class="s81" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">■■ <span class="p">Discipline the organization to stay  at the right level from a higher headquarters</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">perspective. We have heard the common adage before: “One is more comfortable and will default to doing his last job, and not his new job.” Operational and strategic level headquar- ters will be tempted to operate at the tactical level. One commander deliberately kept his headquarters <i>lean </i>so as not to give the staff the capacity or opportunity to take on subordinate headquarters tasks. We continually hear the wisdom in focusing higher headquarters on setting conditions for the success of their sub- ordinates. This is all part of staying at the right level to enable mission command.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:j7.mbx.joint-training@mail.mil" class="s62" target="_blank">The Deployable Training Team point of contact for this article and many other oper- ational-level insight and best practice papers is Mike Findlay.

In many such instances, Beijing implemented a calculus of threat and retaliation signals. Beijing implements this deterrence calculus by a carefully calibrated hierarchy of official protests, authori- tative press comments, and leadership statements. If the crisis persists and Beijing perceives its interests are not satisfactorily taken into account, its statements escalate  in level and may include at first implicit and thereafter increasingly explicit warnings that it may use military force to achieve its goals. This approach has been employed consistently despite the sweeping changes in the PRC’s place in the international order, the proliferation of foreign policy instruments at its disposal, the more complex crisis decisionmaking process and domestic political environment, and the dramatic evolu- tion in Chinese media over the decades.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s209" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 116%;text-align: left;">This study explores the question of whether improving military capabilities will lead Beijing to substitute sudden or surprise attack for the politically calibrated deterrence signaling it has employed prior to its past use of force. It also assesses the problem in four ways. It first reviews China’s use of force since 1949 to determine the motivations driving Beijing’s employment of military coercion. Second, it assesses China’s crisis decisionmaking process and crisis management. Third, it assesses the prospects for China’s more aggressive use of military coercion in Asia’s emerging security environ- ment. Finally, Beijing’s signaling of China’s intent to employ military coercion is as- sessed in detail using a series of crisis case studies covering the years 1961–2004.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="794" height="877" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_150.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s223" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark7">Council of War: A History of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1942–1991</a></p><p class="s224" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: left;">Steven L. Rearden’s <i>Council of War: A History of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1942–1991 </i>surveys the role and contributions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) from the early days of World War II through the end of the Cold War. The JCS, an organization of military advisors and planners established early in World War II, first advised the President on the strategic direction of U.S. Armed Forces in that war and continued afterward to play a significant role in the development of national policy. Because of their relations with the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council, a history of their activities, both in war and in peacetime, provides insights into the military history of the United States. The importance of their activities led the JCS to direct that an official history of their actions be kept for future generations to study. Dr. Rearden’s <i>Council of War </i>follows in the tradition of volumes previously published about JCS involvement in national policy, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Using a combination of primary and secondary sources, and adopting a broader view of previous vol- umes, this fresh work of scholarship examines the military implications of problems from 1942 to 1991. Although focused strongly on the JCS, Rearden’s well-researched treatise deals too with the wider effect of crucial decisions and their ensuing policies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 205pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="67" height="45" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_151.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="58" height="82" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_152.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="31" height="72" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_153.png"/></span></p><p class="s112" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">J O I N T    F O R C E    Q U A R T E R L Y</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="787" height="46" alt="image" src="jfq-71/Image_154.png"/></span></p><p class="s120" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: center;">Published for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by National Defense University Press National Defense University, Washington, DC</p></body></html>
