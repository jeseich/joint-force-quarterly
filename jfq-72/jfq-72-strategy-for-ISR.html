Shortly after the start of the Iraq War, insurgent use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) caused the United States to spend billions of dollars and dedicate substantial resources toward defeating these threats.

In theory, if an insurgent planted an IED</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the time between the two images, an analyst could detect a change on the</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">second image and report the possibility of an IED.<span class="s4">4</span><span class="s6"> </span>Because the collection manag- ers treated all counter-IED requirements equally, MNC-I “peanut-butter spread” U-2 coverage throughout Iraq.<span class="s4">5</span><span class="s6"> </span>As a re- sult, the U-2 could not capture the second image required for change detection until 4 to 5 days after the first, while insurgents often detonated IEDs within hours of planting them.

Finally, collection managers at MNC-I discour- aged U-2 operators and analysts from interacting directly with ground units for fear the units would circumvent their rigid collection request process. Consequently,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U-2 operations did not integrate with the tactical operations they were meant to support.<span class="s4">6</span><span class="s6"> </span>The result was little to no</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">evidence that change detection found any IEDs. Despite this lack of evidence, collec- tion managers, concerned more about the percentage of satisfied requirements than flaws in ISR strategy, continued to task the U-2 to hunt for IEDs via change detec- tion for nearly 5 years.<span class="s4">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">This U-2 example illustrates a decades-old systemic problem with ISR. During the Cold War, limited availability of collection assets and an Industrial</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Age approach to intelligence production favored long-term indications and warn- ing problems focused on large-signature collection targets such as Soviet tank divi- sions. As a result, a system of managing competing requirements emerged that worked well for static environments but failed to adequately integrate ISR opera- tions into dynamic military operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">While a lack of analytic and col- lection resources contributed to ISR problems, it did not explain why the same issues persisted despite a massive infusion of ISR resources into Iraq and Afghanistan.<span class="s4">8</span><span class="s6"> </span>In 2010 the Department of Defense (DOD) ISR Task Force (ISR TF) conducted a study on the utility of ground moving target indicator (GMTI)</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">platforms, such as the E-8C Joint STARS, in Afghanistan. The study found the util- ity was “moderate to low” not because GMTI was inappropriate for the operat- ing environment, but because there was not an effective organizational framework to integrate ISR operations to optimize intelligence and tactical effects.<span class="s4">9</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The following describes how the doctrinal collection management process essentially works. An analyst believes that a specific intelligence discipline, such as GMTI, can identify a signature related to a collection target, which is validated,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">deconflicted, and prioritized by collection managers. A collection manager then tasks an asset to collect the requirement</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">based on the priority ranking and the frequency with which analysts need infor- mation about the collection target.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The ISR TF discovered many draw- backs to this process. First, analysts and collection managers rarely had the appro- priate understanding of ISR capabilities to determine the feasibility of require- ments. Analysts submitted requirements based on limited ISR training prior</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to deploying, and collection manag- ers throughout the validation process often rubber-stamped requirements. For example, analysts would submit</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GMTI requirements over cities failing to recognize GMTI platforms’ inability to distinguish moving targets in the clutter of an urban environment. Second, there was little incentive for time-constrained analysts to remove older requirements from the collection management system. Collection managers provided little oversight on purging the system of stale requirements, yet they would grow frustrated, for example, if their change detection requirements had a 35 percent satisfaction rate.<span class="s4">10</span><span class="s6"> </span>The third problem was that requirements were rarely prioritized to focus ISR on the most important task at any given time. For example, if five different units had counter-IED require- ments in the system, each likely had the same priority, even though four out of five may not have planned any ground movement during the collection cycle.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lastly, there was little to no feedback to determine if intelligence collection was meeting commanders’ expectations. The system focused on whether ISR resources “satisfied” the requirement, which meant collection occurred, not that collection actually met commander’s intent. In short, analysts, collectors, and consum- ers rarely interacted directly, and ISR planners expended more energy on ad- ministering requirements than planning to meet commanders’ objectives.<span class="s4">11</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Many leaders and analysts eventually realized that it was not viable to submit formal intelligence requirements and then hope all the pieces would arrive at the right time.<span class="s4">12</span><span class="s6"> </span>Military units achieved ISR success by focusing less on managing re- quirements and more on ends, ways, and means. In other words, they succeeded</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">when they thought through objectives and concepts to allow commanders to arrange ISR resources in time, space, and purpose.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;">Units found some success in counter- ing IEDs, for example, by refocusing ISR from locating the devices to understand- ing the insurgent network behind them. To meet the <span class="s5">ends </span>of protecting troops from IED attack, ISR planners adjusted the <span class="s5">ways </span>from threat warning to target- ing, and the <span class="s5">means </span>from route scans to manhunting. This new approach required phasing and layering ISR resources against the right targets at the right time. One Marine unit in early 2012, for instance, dedicated 80 percent of its ISR resources to studying insurgent network patterns and linkages. This shift against routine procedures of route scans and patrol over- watch required a great deal of restraint by the unit commander to allow time for ISR efforts to generate targeting intelligence. In this case the Marine unit learned the path to force protection was indirect and was only obtainable by carefully think-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing through the ISR strategy that would achieve the commander’s goals.<span class="s4">13</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Marines’ success juxtaposed with the ineffective Industrial Age require- ments-based processes illustrates the need for new thinking about ISR strategy. The Marines succeeded because they adjusted ISR ends, ways, and means to achieve their commander’s intent. Rather than impose an ISR construct meant for static warning scenarios, commanders must emulate the Marine example and create processes that generate similar effects throughout a joint force engaged in a campaign. Other warf- ighting functions such as joint fire support have a solid foundation and track record for achieving that purpose—that is, inte- grating the ends, ways, and means related to that function with the overall campaign strategy.<span class="s4">14</span><span class="s6"> </span>Joint forces can achieve the same result by developing a process to de- velop and articulate a commander’s intent for ISR.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Developing the Commander’s Intent</h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The goal of an ISR strategy should be to create a problem-centric and not a requirements-centric approach to opera-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 346pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="686" height="461" alt="image" src="jfq-72_39-46_Brown/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">AH-64 Apache attack helicopter at Bagram Airfield after conducting armed reconnaissance operations and precision air strikes (U.S. Air Force/Matt Hecht)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tions. In other words, analysts, platform operators, and consumers should state the problems they must solve, not simply what requirements they must satisfy. Success in military operations increasingly depends on a commander’s ability to unify the ISR enterprise in support of campaign goals. Articulat- ing intent—the traditional method</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that commanders use to establish unity of effort for organizationally complex operations—is the necessary but often overlooked step to focus ISR strategy.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">According to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), <span class="s5">intent</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is one of the basic principles of mis- sion command, which is the operating construct “critical to our future success in defending the nation in an increas- ingly complex and uncertain operation environment.”<span class="s4">15</span><span class="s6"> </span>He continues, “Shared context is a critical enabler of . . . in- tent. In mission command, intent fuses understanding, assigned mission, and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">direction to subordinates. Commanders will be required to clearly translate their intent (and that of higher commanders) to their subordinates and trust them to perform with responsible initiative in complex, fast-changing, chaotic circum- stances.”<span class="s4">16</span><span class="s6"> </span>The key to intent, therefore, is to establish shared context. Lawrence Shattuck states, “It is not enough to tell subordinates what to do and why. When situations permit, commanders should explain how they arrived at the decision. Explaining the rationale helps subordi- nates understand and develop similar patterns of thought.”<span class="s4">17</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">ISR operations over the last decade have demonstrated the importance of explaining intent to higher headquar- ters and outside organizations as well. Major John Ives, the J2 for Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force– Afghanistan (CJSOTF-A), explained how his team sold the ISR strategy for Village Stability Operations (VSO) to establish</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">shared context among higher headquar- ters collection managers and supporting ISR organizations:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fearing our phased non-kinetic collection requirements, taken individually, would go uncollected, the J2 ISR team briefed the plan in its entirety to the <span class="p">[higher headquarters] </span>collection managers (CM). The briefing flowed from the operational macro view of CJSOTF-A’s mission to the tactical micro view of a village stability platform, followed by the comprehensive collection plan as it related to the phases of VSO expansion. . . . Linking the purpose of the collection plan to the individual</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">requirements proved highly productive and informative. The CMs recognized the over- all long term phased collection plan as both sustainable and feasible.<span class="s4">18</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All of this suggests that ISR strategy must start by framing the problem, setting mission expectations, and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 220pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="293" alt="image" src="jfq-72_39-46_Brown/Image_004.png"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Marines load RQ-7B Shadow UAV onto launching ramp, Camp Leatherneck, Helmand Province (U.S. Marine Corps/Robert R. Carrasco)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IPS? What IPS are most relevant in the pursuit of campaign goals? How thin can planners spread resources among IPS while still effectively supporting the campaign? In answering these questions, planners should consider five roles and missions for ISR that emerged in the last decade: understanding the environment, targeting, operational assessment, threat warning, and operations overwatch.<span class="s4">21</span><span class="s6"> </span>The commander must effectively balance these roles and missions by identifying priority, weight of effort, and phasing within the campaign.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ranking Roles and Missions</h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Historically, ISR has been decisive when focused on the right roles and missions at the right time. The U.S. Navy was victorious during the Battle of Midway primarily because signals intelligence</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">outlining objectives in a way that will guide the activities of disparate groups and organizations at all levels toward a common purpose.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Framing Intelligence Problems</h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commanders and their ISR staffs must understand <span class="s5">what </span>they are trying to accomplish before they determine <span class="s5">how </span>to accomplish it. This starts by examining the campaign goals in order to determine the problems ISR opera- tions must solve. The challenge for ISR in recent campaigns is the lack of a common framework for approaching</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">problems to consistently drive collection and analysis. From the 1970s through the 1990s, the DOD Intelligence Com- munity had a clear system for profiling potential adversaries in the form of orders of battle overlaid with capability assessments. While this machine was adequate for conventional scenarios,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it was virtually meaningless to the operations over the past decade, and no framework has clearly arisen to replace it.<span class="s4">19 </span>Intelligence problems have become campaign specific; therefore, planners must make the effort to frame unique problems and not rely on peacetime organizational inertia to define the cat- egories for analysis and collection.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Framing those problems begins with exploring the ends, ways, and means of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the various players who influence the operating environment. That effort can provide planners manageable categories of intelligence problem sets (IPS) to focus ISR planning.<span class="s4">20</span><span class="s6"> </span>Planners must avoid making IPS an order of battle by another name. Categorizing with proper nouns (people, places, and things) can result in analytic gaps; therefore, analysts and planners should focus on behavior and intent as the criteria to define IPS. For example, in assessing threats to air operations, an intelligence organization may spend a great deal of time studying an integrated air defense system (IADS). What an organization may overlook is that the adversary’s primary objective, or end, is <span class="s5">not </span>to shoot down aircraft; it is to <span class="s5">prevent </span>getting bombed. While the or- ganization may pursue this goal by using its IADS, it will likely use other ways and means to achieve the goal—cyber attack or poisoning the airbase water supply, for example. The most appropriate IPS in this scenario would be <span class="s5">adversary attack of our airpower</span>. This ends-ways-means problem framing drill can provide the analytic framework for a campaign and the starting point for focusing ISR.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Once planners identify IPS, they can then determine where and how to leverage the ISR enterprise by asking a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">series of questions. What are the capabili- ties and limitations for ISR against each</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and aerial reconnaissance provided awareness of Japanese operations (threat warning) and reaction to Navy decep- tion efforts (operational assessment).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">During the Korean War, the effort of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. intelligence to analyze the site of the Inchon Landing (understand the environment) enabled the strategic surprise of the amphibious operation. Efforts to understand and destroy key components of air and air defense capa- bilities were the decisive factors in both the Six Days’ War and Operation <span class="s5">Desert Storm </span>(targeting).<span class="s4">22</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Inherent tension between ISR roles and missions, particularly those that require operational and tactical patience (understanding the environment, operational assessment, and targeting networks) and those requiring short-term support (threat warning, operations overwatch, and targeting specific threats) can result in an ineffective application of resources. The counter-IED examples show how competition for assets between roles and missions requires commanders to make clear choices. If commanders</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">do not articulate priorities between roles and missions, planners inevitably revert to spreading resources thinly, primarily to support short-term operational needs, while potentially making ISR ineffective for all missions. As Devaunt LeClaire states, “Using an ISR asset exclusively</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to support operations is ‘robbing Peter to pay Paul’ in that planning based on sound information and intelligence is not possible without robust collections.”<span class="s4">23</span><span class="s6"> </span>Choosing to focus ISR on a single problem set does not guarantee success, however. When commanders focus on roles and missions where ISR is inef- fective (threat warning for IEDs), they siphon resources away from roles and missions where ISR succeeds (targeting the network).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Another dilemma commanders face when developing an ISR strategy is whether to strengthen ineffective ISR roles and missions. While attempts to strengthen ISR capabilities for threat warning against IEDs were mostly inef- fective, efforts to reorient ISR toward understanding the environment and pop- ulation in Iraq and Afghanistan were vital in pursuit of counterinsurgency objec- tives. Adding additional remotely piloted aircraft to the Libya operation improved North Atlantic Treaty Organization targeting capabilities, helping lead to Muammar Qadhafi’s demise.<span class="s4">24</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Determining which roles and missions to emphasize or strengthen requires a constant evaluation of the enterprise’s capabilities, coverage, capacity, and con- straints. ISR planners can use these “4Cs” throughout the development of ISR strategy by asking the following questions about specific resources and the enter- prise as a whole:</p><ul id="l1"><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Are the available resources capable in dealing with the problem sets?</p></li><li style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Is the capacity sufficient to cover the timelines related to the IPS operating scheme?</p></li><li style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Does the enterprise have adequate coverage both geographically and within the networks analysts are trying to understand?</p></li><li style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">What constraints prevent the ideal employment of resources?</p></li></ul><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The answers to these questions can help commanders develop obtainable and relevant objectives for ISR.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stating Objectives</h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Joint doctrine defines an <span class="s5">objective </span>as “a clearly defined, decisive, and attainable</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">goal toward which every operation is directed.”<span class="s4">25 </span>Using campaign goals, IPS, roles and missions, and the 4Cs as a foundation, commanders can develop ISR objectives that provide focus and direction to operational and intel- ligence efforts. ISR objectives can also provide a basis for resource develop- ment, deployment, apportionment, and allocation. Staffs struggle with these activities because collection require- ments provide the foundation for ISR resourcing decisions. Requirements are difficult to regulate, which inevitably leads to an ever-increasing demand for resources and a misrepresentation of needs and risk. The U-2 was continually tasked to conduct change detection,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">for example, because the requirement satisfaction rate was always low and col- lection managers believed they needed to fix that shortfall. If, instead, the ISR staff used an objective such as “Provide threat warning for convoys by delivering intelligence to ground units of probable IED locations,” U-2 change detection missions would have received appropri- ate scrutiny when they did not produce results or, put another way, when the ways and means did not achieve the ends. ISR objectives that flow from commander’s intent and appropriately defined IPS provide a better foundation for ISR assessment.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Objectives provide a common terminology to prioritize the things a commander must <span class="s5">know </span>alongside what he must <span class="s5">do</span>. This is important for working through the competition between roles and missions (that is, should planners</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pull resources off targeting missions to conduct operations overwatch?). As the roles for all types of resources continue to blur—traditional fire and maneuver assets gathering intelligence, for instance—ob- jectives offer a clear process to prioritize both operational actions and intelligence collection for infantry squads, fighter pilots, remotely piloted aircraft crews, and cyber operators alike. Finally, objectives provide a foundation for implementing mission command through mission type orders (MTOs) within an ISR enter- prise.<span class="s4">26</span><span class="s6"> </span>MTOs convey purpose and intent and facilitate the interaction among ISR</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">consumers, platform operators, and ana- lysts.<span class="s4">27</span><span class="s6"> </span>This is the surest way to establish shared context within the organization- ally complex ISR enterprise.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The four components of a com- mander’s intent for ISR—campaign and operational goals, intelligence problem sets, roles and missions, and objec- tives—are the foundation of a strategy. Intent is more than a way to establish shared context and unity of effort; it is an investment in ISR strategy that eventually pays substantial dividends.<span class="s4">28</span><span class="s6"> </span>The largest dividend of intent is the foundation it establishes for leading the ISR enterprise. As organizations become more connected and operations become more complex, leadership in implementing intent matters infinitely more than management.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Implementing the Strategy</h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition to a conceptual framework, commanders and their staffs require a practical method to develop and carry out ISR strategy given information</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">age capabilities and challenges. Iraq provided an example of a higher staff exercising tighter controls to regulate and synchronize ISR in an attempt to deal with emerging organizational and operational complexities.<span class="s4">29 </span>Centralized ISR planning as part of a joint opera- tional planning process may work well in the early phases of a campaign and in high-risk scenarios; however, as opera- tions progress, headquarters attempting to control diversified and distributed processes and organizations can stifle the ISR enterprise’s ability to adapt to changing conditions in a campaign.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Despite lessons from Iraq and Afghani- stan, joint doctrine still emphasizes</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a centralized method for developing ISR strategy, failing to account for the complex command relationships or the increasingly collaborative nature of ISR planning that affects the full spectrum of operations.<span class="s4">30 </span>Rather than focus on centralized planning, commanders should concentrate on synchronizing ISR strategy teams at multiple echelons and components through appropriate resourcing, relationships, and processes.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">While not using the term <span class="s5">ISR strategy teams</span>, in recent campaigns formal or</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">working groups emerged within organi- zations to flatten hierarchical structures and integrate expertise to improve ISR operations. Commanders and their staffs can discern practical methods to integrate these teams by specifically examining strategy improvements between the height of operations in Iraq (2006–2008) and Afghanistan (2010–2012). There were significant differences between the campaigns that partially account for these improvements including wider dispersal of units, a greater coalition presence,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and a much larger armada of ISR as- sets in Afghanistan. However, the most important lessons on ISR strategy from Afghanistan are not related to ostensible situational advantages, but rather come from structural and procedural improve- ments that reduced friction, promoted planning integration, and encouraged operational creativity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Identifying the Lessons</h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the height of operations in Afghani- stan, commanders made two key structural improvements to ISR strategy as compared to Iraq. First, the United States dedicated more manpower to ISR planning at multiple echelons.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This included deploying Air Force ISR liaison officers (ISRLOs) to brigade- and battalion-level units. Embedding ISRLOs created de facto ISR strategy teams that effectively worked through the 4Cs of ISR strategy and flattened hierarchal planning processes. Second, the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command (IJC) offered greater incentives for planners to think through ends, ways, and means rather than flooding the system with require- ments. While headquarters in both Iraq and Afghanistan conducted Joint Col- lection Management Boards to allocate resources, the former focused on the number of operations and require- ments as a means to justify allocation, while the latter encouraged analytic rigor in its allocation process. Subor- dinate units in Afghanistan more often had to explain not simply <span class="s5">what </span>they needed but <span class="s5">how </span>they would employ ISR resources. The introduction of the ISR MTO concept, which provided tacti-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cal units greater flexibility in execut- ing operations and an organizational construct to share operational context, offered another incentive to integrate strategies. IJC required detailed coordi- nation and planning before approving ISR MTOs. In short, higher head- quarters in Afghanistan focused more on prioritization, and units were more likely to receive resources and/or more flexibility when they invested intel- lectual capital in ISR strategy instead</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of simply submitting requirements. This second structural improvement— designing a system that encouraged better planning—could not have hap- pened without the first improvement— resourcing units with the right people to carry out that planning.<span class="s4">31</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Building the Team</h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Given those lessons, how should ISR strategy teams organize and operate? Describing how special operations forces designed their ISR teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, USA, wrote in 2008, the “organizational imperative was simple: get the best people and bring them together face to face in a single location collaborating on a target set while orchestrating reachback support to their national offices.”<span class="s4">32 </span>But what if face-to-face interaction is not feasible? Organizational and logistical constraints may lead to a distributed ISR strategy team connected by modern technol- ogy. While not always ideal, there were numerous examples in Afghanistan where a distributed construct worked when members were focused on launch- ing planning efforts, building relation- ships, and remaining relevant. Whether formal, ad hoc, face to face, or distrib- uted, ISR strategy teams succeeded with the right mix of analysts, capability experts, and consumers with the right planning, critical thinking, and leader- ship abilities.<span class="s4">33</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Effective teams must include ac- tive leadership and expertise to break through the inherent imperfection of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">processes, technology, and organizational structures. Simply relying on formal, impersonal processes will not sufficiently</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">focus the enterprise to solve a unit’s intel- ligence problems. ISR strategy teams must address challenges through leader- ship, tradecraft, policy, and technology, in that order. Too often, commanders and staffs approach problems in the reverse. As Timothy Oliver, who served five tours in Iraq and as an intelligence battalion commander in Afghanistan, asserts, “Any success or failure of intelligence stems from the same source as other types of military failures, from the leadership.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Intelligence must be an ‘all hands’ ef- fort, and commanders, consumers, and producers all must drive this process and insist on its success.”<span class="s4">34</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fostering Relationships</h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ISR strategy consistently succeeds when team leaders overcome the challenges of multiorganizational complexity and lack of unity of command by building solid personal relationships. Alterna- tively, poor relationships often directly contribute to ineffective ISR strategy. Because every commander’s level of confidence and perception of risk are</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">linked to ISR, competition for resources between organizations can quickly become personal. Trust can easily break down when teams begin to stereotype along organizational lines and argue over command relationships. Trust depends on selecting knowledgeable team members who can break down cultural and organizational barriers in pursuit of mission accomplishment and installing the right leaders to direct their efforts.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Leaders overcome barriers and cre- ate trust by demonstrating transparency, empathy, and competence. Major Ives provides an example: “Our ISR team’s proficient grasp of collection manage- ment created a mutual trust with the IJC ISR planners. Over the next few days, our two teams worked hand-in-hand towards a theater-wide effort supporting the original purpose of the focus area collec- tion without disrupting the IJC priority collection plan for ongoing named opera- tions.”<span class="s4">35</span><span class="s6"> </span>Ives illustrates the success that well-resourced teams had when operating within a system that incentivized both competence and interaction. Valuing</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">competence and creating trust resulted in a virtuous circle that reinforced itself over time, leading to a willingness to accept greater risk to obtain greater payoff in future ISR operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Testing the Process</h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trust alone, however, will not deliver success. ISR strategy teams must also build an effective structure and process to meet mission requirements. Other than identifying the need to integrate effectively within operational plan- ning processes, any other prescriptive guidance on developing ISR strategy would not likely apply across a broad spectrum. Leaders must avoid making</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the campaign fit a doctrinal process, and must instead design a process to fit the campaign. That said, planners should apply several tests to any ISR strategy development process.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">First, does the process minimize and scrutinize assumptions? Unlike fire and maneuver capabilities, ISR does not have an adequate test and evaluation process. As a result, ISR planners often rely on assumptions about capabilities versus collection targets, and consequently they should conduct thorough operational assessments to continuously evaluate those assumptions. Planners may assume a sensor is adequate for finding IEDs but must develop a feedback loop that focuses on the interplay of enemy and friendly activities to determine the as- sumption’s validity.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Second, does the process minimize gaps and seams in a way that creates a problem-centric ISR enterprise? ISR teams must work through organizational complexity by refining the process to make the enterprise act as a whole.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Organizing constructs including ISR objectives, MTOs, or a find-fix-finish- exploit-analyze targeting model can provide the synchronization needed for a problem-centric approach.<span class="s4">36</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Third, does the process allow for resources to quickly mass and disperse with minimal friction? Losing ISR re- sources to another unit or mission often creates a significant emotional event for commanders and staffs. This can cause staffs at multiple levels to expend energy</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on organizational knife fights instead of future planning. Organizations can over- come this friction when commander’s intent is adequately developed, updated, and communicated in a way that sub- ordinate commanders perceive that the allocation decisions are consistent and in line with campaign goals. IJC’s priori- tization and weighting scheme enabled massing and dispersal while limiting fric- tion because ISR stakeholders at all levels understood that IJC made its allocation decisions in line with the commander’s priorities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">When designing processes to develop ISR strategy, commanders and staffs should consider important lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan that demonstrate the need for dedicated teams at multiple levels to continually refine ISR strategy. Investment in leadership, manpower, relationships, and balanced processes are critical to making these teams effective.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This focus provides the best method to ensure shared context and expertise</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">throughout the enterprise. It also over- comes the disaggregation inherent in the requirements-based collection manage- ment process. As Lieutenant General Flynn concludes:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If we do more synchronized planning with greater rigor right from the start, using our operations planning process, we can provide our subordinate units greater flex- ibility and less uncertainty. At the end of the day, we achieve success in combat when subordinate units collectively understand the mission and higher commands have properly resourced them for success. Then and only then can they accomplish a well- synchronized campaign plan.<span class="s4">37</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ISR strategy should provide focused direction and create a shared context that orients the ISR enterprise toward problem-solving over production.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Articulating intent, as the CJCS asserts, is the best method to achieve these aims. The commander’s intent for ISR should define intelligence problems and identify the critical ISR roles and mis- sions to address those problems based</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on the capabilities, coverage, capacity, and constraints of available resources. Intent must guide the enterprise and joint force toward achieving specific ISR objectives that support campaign goals. In short, intent balances the ends, ways, and means of ISR operations and facili- tates leader efforts to integrate intel- ligence and operations in ways modern military campaigning demands.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The key to developing and imple- menting ISR strategy is finding ways to move organizations, relationships, and processes toward collaboration, trust, and incentives. During recent operations, leaders created ISR strategy successes when they overcame organizational inertia and doctrinal restrictions that impeded integration. This happened when leaders focused teams of experts at multiple echelons on ISR strategy. These teams balanced the needs of lower level commanders with campaign goals and re-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">duced friction between organizations that inevitably occurs in operations involving life and death.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The role of ISR in building confi- dence and reducing risk naturally leads to competition over resources. Less suc- cessful attempts to reduce pressure and friction in recent campaigns included throwing resources at problems or spreading them evenly among organiza- tions without adequately balancing ISR ends, ways, and means. The struggle to counter IEDs offers an example of how organizations can obsess over numbers while losing sight of operational realities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The last decade drove significant learning on ways to make ISR relevant in high- tempo operations. The joint force must codify the hard lessons learned on evolv- ing ISR processes that reduce friction and increase timeliness while retaining a focus on priorities and effectiveness. Failure to do so will mean future commanders and staffs will once again spend energy and resources chasing white whales instead of developing winning ISR strategies.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">When faced with information age challenges and their impact on ISR op- erations, many still insist better adherence to collection management doctrine is the answer. Departure from proven doctrine has certainly led to disaster for military</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">forces in the past. However, joint ISR doctrine has yet to prove itself in major operations without significant modifica- tion. If there is one fundamental flaw in current joint doctrine, it is that ISR is <span class="s5">managed</span>, while other forms of operation are <span class="s5">led</span>—and doctrine that relies on man- agement over leadership will fail time and again in the heat of battle. <span class="h3">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="216" height="1" alt="image" src="jfq-72_39-46_Brown/Image_005.png"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">1 <span class="s13">Patrick W.
