He was even the topic of a full-length Hollywood movie titled <span class="s3">The Court-Martial of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s3">Billy Mitchell</span>, starring another iconic American, Gary Cooper.<span class="s4">4</span><span class="s5"> </span>Unfortunately, most of the attention about Mitchell goes to his court-martial and his stormy rela- tionship with the Army and Navy brass.</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yet one of the most fascinating aspects of his career was that he was a newcomer to aviation at the outset of World War</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I.

At this point in his career, Captain Mitchell was one of the rising stars of the Signal Corps, and at age 32 the youngest officer on the Army’s new General Staff.<span class="s4">5 </span>Instead of creating aviation as a separate branch of the Army, as proponents of indepen- dence hoped, Congress established the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps in</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">1914.<span class="s4">6 </span>Accordingly, airpower advocates viewed Mitchell as antagonistic to their goals.<span class="s4">7</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Interestingly, a scandal at the Army’s flying school in San Diego resulted in Mitchell’s transfer from the General Staff in 1916 to the Aviation Section.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As historian Juliette A. Hennessy noted, “A basic cause of the trouble was . . . that young flying officers wanted an air organization separate from the Signal</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Corps.”<span class="s4">8</span><span class="s5"> </span>Because of his stellar reputation, Mitchell was selected to temporarily head the Aviation Section after its chief was relieved. Mitchell’s job was to restore “old-fashioned military discipline among the so-called prima-donna pilots,” opined Benjamin Foulois, one of the leaders</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of those prima donnas.<span class="s4">9</span><span class="s5"> </span>Later, Mitchell stayed on to become the deputy to the new aviation chief, Lieutenant Colonel George Squier, who returned from Europe where he had been observing aviation developments in the war.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">It was during this period that a bitter rivalry developed between Mitchell and the pioneer Army aviator (and prima donna) Benjamin Foulois. Although Mitchell may be America’s premier airpower prophet and martyr, Foulois rightly deserves to be called the father of American airpower. He flew with Orville Wright in 1909 on the Army’s accep- tance tests for its first airplane. He took Army No. 1 to Fort Sam Houston and, as ordered, taught himself to fly it. He helped form the Army’s first Provisional Aero Company and commanded 1<span class="s4">st</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aero Squadron during General John J. Pershing’s Punitive Expedition against Pancho Villa. Foulois’s command rep- resented America’s first employment of airpower on a major expedition. Although the squadron was incapable of adequately accomplishing its reconnaissance mis- sion due to the inferiority of its airplanes, valuable lessons were learned that would be useful when Foulois helped build an American air force for World War I.<span class="s4">10</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Mitchell, from his comfortable perch at aviation headquarters in Washington, DC, harassed Foulois in the Mexican des- ert during the Punitive Expedition about such details as unauthorized purchases</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of gasoline. Later, as the United States mobilized for war in Europe, Mitchell’s plans for the expansion of the Air Service overlooked establishing bases in the U.S. South and Southwest with their superior weather. Instead he focused on basing</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the North and East, which was politi- cally astute but revealed his ignorance on such practical matters as good flying conditions.<span class="s4">11</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Foulois referred to Mitchell’s tour of duty in the Aviation Section as “a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">supreme irony which almost wrecked mil- itary aviation in this country.”<span class="s4">12</span><span class="s5"> </span>Foulois continued, “Billy must have known that his days were numbered insofar as his usefulness as Squier’s deputy was con- cerned. In March [1917] Mitchell asked for orders detailing him for duty as an observer of military aviation in Europe.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As soon as Mitchell left, I was ordered to Washington to take his place.”<span class="s4">13</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Mitchell was actually well suited for the job as an official observer because he spoke French, and the assignment provided an ideal stepping-stone to combat command. He toured the front, took detailed notes, and learned about air strategy, tactics, and organization through repetitive visits with the French and British air commanders and their units.<span class="s4">14</span><span class="s5"> </span>Most important, Mitchell’s job required him to systematically record, reflect on, and analyze what he saw. “I was a different breed of cat from any</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the others they had seen,” he wrote in his hotel room at Chalons after visit- ing French pursuit commander Victor</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Menard. “Deep into the night they could</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">hear my typewriter clicking as I wrote up my notes.”<span class="s4">15</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Mitchell kept up this habit of writing about daily experiences in his journal throughout the war as he moved from one position to another.<span class="s4">16</span><span class="s5"> </span>The modern reader cannot help but be impressed with his observations and analysis. Thus, it was not only being one of the first American aviation officers on the scene,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but also his systematic and disciplined ap- proach to learning that helped Mitchell develop a superior understanding of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">air warfare. By reviewing, writing, and processing his daily observations, he developed the insights that would help him learn the operational art from the airman’s perspective. Keeping a journal helped him learn.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Air Service Expands</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">As the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) and its Air Service expanded in France during 1917, officers moved from position to position, as did Mitch- ell. He quickly advanced to colonel, becoming the air commander of the Zone of Advance. During this period, however, Mitchell commanded no avia- tion units because none had yet arrived in the Zone of Advance. He functioned mainly as a planner, all the while anticipating, studying, and laying the groundwork for the future employment of American airpower.<span class="s4">17</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The main effort for the Air Service at this time was not Mitchell’s responsibil- ity but rather that of his counterpart, Colonel Raynal Bolling, who com- manded the Zone of the Interior and focused on the larger job of aircraft procurement, training, and reception of deploying units that were beginning to arrive in France. Pershing had decided to conduct the final organization, train- ing, and equipping of the Air Service</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in France because the Americans were so far behind the Europeans in military aviation. It was a key strategic decision perfectly suited to the strategy of the French and British, who needed to build American partnership capacity to help them win the war.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">This so-called Dual Monarchy of Bolling and Mitchell ended with the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 230pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="307" alt="image" src="jfq-72_96-101_Frandsen/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">General Mitchell standing by Vought VE-7 Bluebird (U.S. Air Force)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">air forces. He knew more about these subjects than any other senior American officer.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Subsequently, the first observation and pursuit squadrons arrived in the I Corps area, known as the Toul sector. This was a quiet part of the front where American units gained initial combat ex- perience under the control of the French Eighth Army. It was a peculiar command arrangement that provided Mitchell</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with maximum flexibility. He was not responsible for the orchestration of flying operations, nor did he issue daily opera- tions orders because the French army performed this function, but he did have administrative jurisdiction. Captain Philip Roosevelt, the operations officer of 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Pursuit Group, wrote, “God knows what his authority was, but as usual we decided that if it came to a question of getting</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">arrival of Benjamin Foulois in November</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1917.<span class="s4">18</span><span class="s5"> </span>Foulois was the obvious choice to lead the Air Service because of his command of 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Aero Squadron on Pershing’s Punitive Expedition. He had quickly advanced from major to brigadier general back in Washington where he had finished laying the groundwork for the mobilization of American airpower.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Foulois brought his own staff and reassigned both Bolling and Mitchell to new jobs, removing them from key posi- tions in the headquarters and replacing them with officers who had accompanied him across the Atlantic. Mitchell was greatly embittered with this treatment: “A more incompetent lot of air warriors had never arrived in the zone of active military operations since the war began. . . . The competent men, who had learned their duties in the face of the enemy, were dis- placed and their positions taken by these carpetbaggers.”<span class="s4">19</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Foulois’s dismissal of Bolling and Mitchell was a colossal error. The veteran from the Punitive Expedition failed to transition from tactical to senior leader- ship, where building consensus with other senior leaders and peers is so important. In effect, his reassignment of Mitchell and Bolling decapitated the Air Service at a time when recently acquired institutional knowledge was more impor- tant than ever. The growth rate of the Air</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Service was just then rapidly accelerating as the effect of American mobilization began to make itself felt.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Foulois assigned Mitchell to be the chief of Air Service, I Corps.<span class="s4">20</span><span class="s5"> </span>Though a personal setback, this “demotion” removed Mitchell just as a tsunami of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">administrative and logistical issues arrived at the doorstep of his successor. American aero squadrons were beginning to reach the Zone of Advance at various orga- nization and training centers (pursuit, bombardment, observation), where they received their aircraft and equipment and were made combat ready before being assigned to the front.<span class="s4">21</span><span class="s5"> </span>In contrast, when Mitchell arrived at the recently organized I Corps headquarters, it did not yet have operational control of any American combat units. As before, he did not com- mand much of anything. He joined a headquarters whose staff was itself under- going organization and training.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Like the other members of the staff, Mitchell conducted a study of his area of responsibility undistracted by the daily grind of command. This time he focused on the enemy: the organization, aircraft, and operations of the German air force.<span class="s4">22</span><span class="s5"> </span>Thus, by the spring of 1918, Mitchell had spent a year in France, developed plans for the tactical organization of the Air Service, and conducted in-depth studies of both the friendly and opposing</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">along . . . we would do all the getting along.”<span class="s4">23</span><span class="s5"> </span>These early operations provided Mitchell the opportunity to begin taking the measure of his men and machines in their first combats.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Mitchell also polished his flying skills. He arrived in France without the wings of an aviator, but the limited responsi- bilities of successive jobs enabled him to build on the flying lessons he began in the States. By then he had become an accomplished pilot, even learning to fly America’s first fighter, the French-made Nieuport 28, which was a difficult plane to handle because of the gyroscopic effect created by its rotary engine. In May 1918 he led a six-plane exhibition flight of 94<span class="s4">th</span><span class="s5"> </span>Aero Squadron’s Nieuport 28s during an awards ceremony in which the command- ing general of the French Eighth Army presented the <span class="s3">Croix de guerre </span>to several officers of the 94<span class="s4">th</span>, including Eddie Rickenbacker, in recognition of their first victories against the Germans.<span class="s4">24</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">In contrast, many of the experienced prewar Army aviators, such as Foulois and Colonel Robert Van Horn, who had replaced Mitchell as commander of the Zone of Advance, were so overwhelmed with the workload of building the Air Service that they simply could not devote time to learning to fly the latest combat aircraft. They could never lead by ex- ample as Mitchell did.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">While at Toul, Mitchell anticipated the establishment of an Army headquar- ters that would be needed to control multiple corps as American doughboys poured into France. He established a provisional air headquarters for First Army. As happened before to Mitchell in the Zone of Advance, however, he was removed from this position just as First Army was nearing activation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The deteriorating state of affairs in the Air Service, exacerbated by the earlier decapitation of its senior leadership, resulted in Pershing dismissing Foulois. His replacement, engineer officer Major General Mason Patrick, remembered Pershing describing the Foulois regime as “good men running around in circles.”<span class="s4">25</span><span class="s5"> </span>As the dominoes fell, Foulois arrived at the provisional air headquarters for First Army and told Mitchell, “There’s no</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">use beating around the bush, Billy, I’m here to take over your office, your files, and your job. You are relieved as of this moment.”<span class="s4">26</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">More than mortified, this time Mitchell was insubordinate. In response to Foulois’s request to stay on a few days to help with transition, Mitchell responded, “Not on your life, General.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. . . [Y]ou couldn’t possibly acquire the knowledge to run this office in a few days and I’ll be damned if I’m going to make it easy for you.”<span class="s4">27</span><span class="s5"> </span>He refused to hand over officer furniture, maps, and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">even the telephone. It was a low point for Mitchell. Word spread throughout the upper echelons of the AEF that he was not a team player. Foulois asked Pershing to send Mitchell back to the United States, but Pershing instead counseled Mitchell and required Foulois to make the best of it.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Yet again this setback would ironi- cally provide Mitchell the opportunity to further his study of air warfare, gain experience in a major coalition air op- eration, and surpass Foulois as the most important American air leader to emerge from World War I. By the end of May, Germany’s last great offensive, launched in March, had reached Château-Thierry only 40 miles from Paris. The resulting panic led to the piecemeal commitment of Soldiers and Marines to reinforce</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sixth French Army, which was reeling back from the German onslaught. The Marines fought one of their most famous battles at Belleau Wood, and the Army’s 3<span class="s4">rd</span><span class="s5"> </span>Infantry Division won the moniker “Rock of the Marne” for its stalwart de- fense along that river.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">After observing these initial battles, one of Pershing’s scouts sent a strongly worded report back to AEF headquar- ters: “I recommend that an observation and a pursuit squadron of aero planes be sent here to work with this division at [the] first opportunity. The Germans have control of the air and embarrass our movements and dispositions.”<span class="s4">28</span><span class="s5"> </span>Consequently, Pershing ordered American aviation to the Marne sector along with the 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Corps headquarters,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">which provided overall command for ad- ditional American units reinforcing the French.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Despite their previous falling out (but also getting Mitchell away from the First Army sector), Foulois put Mitchell in command of 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Air Brigade, a new organization created to accompany</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. reinforcements to the beleaguered Sixth French Army. Mitchell’s command consisted of 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Pursuit Group and 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Observation Group. Again, the lines</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of authority were unclear. First Pursuit Group received its operations orders from the chief of the Air Service of Sixth Army, which was in overall command of the sector. That was logical because the American Pursuit Group replaced Sixth Army’s former Pursuit Group, which had been practically shot out of the sky. First Observation Group, which directly sup- ported 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Corps with reconnaissance and artillery adjustment, took its orders from the corps.<span class="s4">29</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">These unclear command relation- ships created a difficult conundrum for Mitchell’s subordinates, who sometimes received orders from multiple head- quarters. Roosevelt explained, “I had</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to spend a lot of time seeming to obey their orders while really making my own dispositions. . . . All our orders really came from the French—which [Mitchell] approved.”<span class="s4">30</span><span class="s5"> </span>To be sure, the Army was still working out the nuances of com- mand relationships between the pursuit</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and observation groups and the armies and corps they supported. This was made all the more difficult while fighting under French command. Today, we would call Mitchell a COMAFFOR (commander of Air Force forces) who had OPCON (op- erational control) of U.S. 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Pursuit and 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Observation groups. He was support- ing a French CFACC (combined force air component commander) who had TACON (tactical control) of the U.S. air forces of 1<span class="s4">st</span><span class="s5"> </span>Air Brigade. But these sorts of command relationships had not yet been created.<span class="s4">31</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, Mitchell’s presence enabled him to organize a tactical head- quarters, which he located adjacent to the air headquarters of Sixth French Army just as it was preparing to conduct the largest combined air operation of the war up to that time. The Marne campaign served as his postgraduate education in aerial warfare.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Initiative Shifts</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anticipating a renewal of the German offensive, Allied Commander in Chief General Ferdinand Foch assembled a large air force as a strategic reserve. It consisted of the French Air Division, the Royal Air Force 9<span class="s4">th </span>Brigade, and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. 1<span class="s4">st </span>Pursuit Group. The French Air Division was the largest single avia- tion unit of the war. Its two brigades represented some 370 fighters and 230 bombers. Ninth Brigade provided an additional nine squadrons of offensive airpower. Added to that were the four squadrons of 1<span class="s4">st </span>Pursuit Group.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">With his brigade headquarters col- located with the French Sixth Army air headquarters, Mitchell learned how to integrate multinational airpower in a large operation. Once the battle began on July 15, 1918, the combined forces established air superiority and attacked German crossing sites along the Marne. This operation helped defeat the German army in the most decisive battle of the war, known as the Second Battle of the Marne. After that, the Allies seized the initiative and never lost it. Germany would be defeated a few months later.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, Pershing finally activated First Army and was preparing for the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 398pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="686" height="531" alt="image" src="jfq-72_96-101_Frandsen/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">German Hannover CL IIIa brought down in Argonne by American machinegunners on October 4, 1918 (U.S. Army/NARA/J.E. Gibbon)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Saint-Mihiel offensive. The stakes were high because the United States had yet to demonstrate the ability to campaign on the European battlefield. Realizing that Mitchell was his best and most experi- enced air commander, Pershing returned him to the position of chief of Air Service of First Army, replacing Foulois who, to his credit, supported the decision and took a new job that focused on training and logistics.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">First Army’s mission was to reduce the Saint-Mihiel salient, a large bulge in Allied lines that had existed since the early days of the war. Foch was eager for Pershing to finish this attack quickly because he wanted the Americans to concentrate their main effort in the Meuse-Argonne sector, joining the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">French and British for the final offensives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Accordingly, he reinforced Pershing with troops and enablers, especially artillery and aviation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The French, British, and even Italians provided air units to reinforce the American Air Service’s 28 squadrons. The total force numbered 701 pursuit planes, 366 observation planes, 323 day bomb- ers, and 91 night bombers adding up to 1,481 aircraft for the largest air operation of the war.<span class="s4">32</span><span class="s5"> </span>In contrast to the Allied defensive battle on the Marne, Mitchell’s plan supported an offensive operation and therefore took an entirely different approach. While American combat avia- tion operated within 3 miles of the front, Mitchell ordered the French Air Division to attack 12 to 20 miles behind enemy lines. By pressing the attack, he kept his enemy off balance and on the defensive,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">unable to interfere with the First Army offensive.<span class="s4">33</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Saint-Mihiel occupies a special place in airpower history not only because it was the largest single air operation of the war. The concentration of coalition air forces did its part in helping Pershing</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to wipe out the salient and achieve a successful inauguration of American arms in continental warfare. Mitchell’s example provided a vision for unity of command that would inspire airmen long after he passed from the scene. His continued command for the upcoming Meuse-Argonne offensive was a foregone conclusion. Just prior to the end of the war, Pershing made Mitchell chief of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Air Service for an Army group that would command First and Second U.S. Armies.<span class="s4">34</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Billy Mitchell’s experience in World War I is an ironic story of learning and adapting. Each setback he experienced could have been, and probably was, perceived as a failure. He commanded the Zone of Advance but was removed</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">environment for Mitchell’s creative and adaptive spirit to soar. Through a com- bination of persistence and a systematic approach to learning, Billy Mitchell adapted and learned the operational art from the airman’s perspective. <span class="h4">JFQ</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12 <span class="s11">Ibid., 125.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">13 <span class="s11">Ibid., 141.</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">14 <span class="s11">Cooke, 51.</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">15 </span>William Mitchell, <span class="s12">Memoirs of World War I: From Start to Finish of Our Greatest War </span>(New York: Random House, 1928), 26.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;">16 <span class="s11">Mitchell’s published memoir “probably represents the diary to a remarkable degree.”</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">Ibid., vi.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">from that prestigious position just as it       <u>                                                             </u></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">17 <span class="s11">Bert Frandsen, </span><span class="s12">Hat in the Ring: The Birth</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">was becoming active. Although bitter about his relief, he showed initiative in establishing the office of the provisional air chief of First Army. Removed yet again, one sees this tendency for him</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to be “demoted” to positions where his authority and responsibility were</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reduced. The irony is that without these setbacks, he would not have had such ideal opportunities to learn. By the time the AEF was ready to conduct its first major offensive, even Foulois, who had asked Pershing to send Mitchell back to the States, admitted that Mitchell was the best man to command air opera- tions in the AEF’s final offensives.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Did Mitchell see it so optimisti- cally at the time? His memoir suggests he was filled with resentment in each instance. He may have even feared he had been sidelined permanently. But as we have seen, setbacks can be learning opportunities. Indeed, it is the point of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tim Hartford’s recent book <span class="s3">Adapt: Why Success Always Starts with Failure</span>.<span class="s4">35</span><span class="s5"> </span>In spite of setbacks, Mitchell persisted with an intensity that was undergirded by the self-confidence born of an inner light.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He derived this <span class="s3">coup d’oeil </span>by developing a degree of competence in aerial warfare that far exceeded his American peers.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His study of this new type of warfare was supercharged by the fact that throughout the war, whatever his position, he regu- larly made time to systematically process his experience by writing down his daily observations and analyzing what they meant. This practice helped him gain understanding.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">One of the ironies of life is that setbacks can have silver linings, but to exploit this irony, we must learn, adapt, and more often than not persist in the face of adversity.
