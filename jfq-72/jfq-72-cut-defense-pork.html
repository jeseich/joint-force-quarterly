He has been selected to command 69<span class="s9">th</span><span class="s10"> </span>Reconnaissance Group at Grand Forks, ND.</p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to Congress last year but was similarly rebuffed.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Defense as a Jobs Program</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lawmakers habitually spend more on defense than the Pentagon requests because they treat the defense budget as a jobs program. In the case of the M1 tank, Congress was unwilling to close the production line because it provides 16,000 jobs at 882 suppliers spread widely among congressional districts.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In short, parochial interests triumphed over national security requirements.</p><p style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Services share some of the blame.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They recognize that many in Congress prioritize jobs within their districts, which is why most major weapons systems</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">have parts built in nearly every state. For example, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new fighter jet designed for the Air Force and Navy, has 1,300 suppliers in 47 states and Puerto Rico. While this legislative strategy helps gain approval for new weapon systems, it is a Faustian bargain because it entrenches the political power of the defense industry and saddles the Services with inventories of strategically obsolete weapons that Congress loathes to cut.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Money used to maintain these expensive, unnecessary, and unwanted weapons could be better spent elsewhere. In March 2012, Lieutenant General Robert Lennox, the deputy chief of staff for Army programs (G8), emphasized that the Army does not have the budget to support legacy systems to prop up the defense industry. He used a historical analogy to deride Congress’s decision to buy more M1 tanks notwithstanding a lack of need: “We don’t want to be in the position of 1939 when we say we have to go out and protect the saber and saddle industry because our cavalry is going to need it for the future. We have to make sure we got the right industrial challenges for the future and those are the ones we have to focus on.”<span class="s5">4</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Not only does innovation suffer, but readiness suffers as well. “There is pressure on the department to retain excess force structure and infrastructure instead of investing in the training and</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">equipment that makes our force agile and flexible and ready,” observed Secretary Panetta in December 2012 remarks at the National Press Club. “Aircraft, ships,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tanks, bases, even those that have outlived their usefulness have a natural political constituency. Readiness does not.”<span class="s5">5</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Past statements by then-Senator Chuck Hagel suggest the new Secretary will be keen to prevent Congress from throwing money at wasteful defense projects. In June 2011, he lectured fel- low lawmakers: “You guys have it upside down. Our Defense Department budget</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. . . is not a jobs program. It’s not an economic development program for my state or any district.”<span class="s5">6</span><span class="s6"> </span>One way Secretary Hagel can counter Congress’s penchant for pork is to advocate for the revival of Presidential impoundment, an execu- tive branch tool used to enforce fiscal prudence. Impoundment occurs when the President delays or refuses to spend money appropriated by Congress.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Thomas Jefferson set precedent for impoundment in 1803 when he sus- pended the purchase of 15 gunboats.<span class="s5">7</span><span class="s6"> </span>In his Third Annual Message to Congress, President Jefferson stated, “The favor- able and peaceable turn of affairs on</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary.” Furthermore, he explained, “Time was desirable in order that the institution of that branch of our force might begin on models the most approved by experi- ence.”<span class="s5">8</span><span class="s6"> </span>In short, Jefferson exercised his discretion as Commander in Chief and chief executive. He impounded congres- sionally appropriated funds based on his assessment of the strategic situation and his desire to purchase new and better models at a later date.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The U.S. Constitution established a system of checks and balances that entrusts the “power of the purse” to Congress under Article I. However,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Article II assigns the executive branch the authority to expend appropriated funds. A 1995 Senate budget committee report noted, “This tug-of-war goes to the most basic tenet of the American democratic system of government—the balance of powers between the executive and the legislative branches of government—the power of the purse versus the impound- ment power.”<span class="s5">9</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">For 170 years after Jefferson claimed the power of impoundment, Presidents at</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">various times and for various reasons ex- ercised that authority. They mostly used it for narrow defense-related purposes, trimming expenditures for weapons they deemed unnecessary.<span class="s5">10</span><span class="s6"> </span>For example, Harry Truman refused to spend $735 million to increase the Air Force from 48 to 58 groups. Dwight Eisenhower set aside $137 million for the Nike-Zeus missile system. And John Kennedy,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on the advice of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, withheld $180 mil- lion to end the XB-70 Valkyrie bomber program.<span class="s5">11</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Congress Fights Back</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Congress sometimes acquiesced to Pres- idents’ actions while at other times the parties negotiated a political settlement. However, the balance of power changed as a result of President Richard Nixon, who expanded the scope and magnitude of Presidential impoundments, holding back between 17 and 20 percent of controllable expenditures between</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1969 and 1972. In 1973, under the guise of controlling inflation caused by high levels of government spending to support the Vietnam War, he suspended nearly $15 billion, almost 20 percent of controllable spending, which affected over a hundred Federal programs.<span class="s5">12 </span>Congress fought back and passed the Congressional Budget and Impound- ment Control Act (CBICA) of 1974, which had the objective of curtailing the President’s budgetary powers. The act outlawed impoundment, requiring the executive branch to spend every last penny of congressional appropriations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Nixon denied that Congress had the constitutional authority to impose such a restriction. However, weakened by the Watergate scandal, he elected not to fight it. Nixon resigned a month after the CBICA became law. The new Ford administration, not wanting to further antagonize a hostile Congress, chose to comply with the law rather than appeal to the Supreme Court.<span class="s5">13</span><span class="s6"> </span>That decision,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">according to Senator John McCain, con- tributed to “exploding” deficits. “It is not coincidence that up until 1974 revenues and expenditures . . . were in sync,” opined McCain during a 1995 Senate</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 333pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="686" height="445" alt="image" src="jfq-72_65-68_Spinetta/Image_002.png"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">M1 Abrams battle tanks (DAC/Don Teft)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">debate. “There are times . . . in war when we ran up huge deficits. But after those emergencies subsided, we again brought the budget into balance. It was in 1974 when the two began to diverge to an incredible degree.”<span class="s5">14</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The CBICA fundamentally shifted the budgetary balance of power between Congress and the President. The law allowed the President to request rescis- sions, but that was only permitted if both houses of Congress consented. Not</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">surprisingly, subsequent to the enactment of CBICA, Congress has simply ignored Presidential rescission requests, killing them through inaction.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The CBICA granted more leeway with deferrals. The President was au- thorized to defer spending unless either the House or Senate passed legislation disapproving the request. (Note that appropriated funds still had to be spent before the end of the fiscal year.) In 1986 the Supreme Court reviewed the CBICA deferral provision and ruled one-house</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">vetoes of Presidential actions uncon- stitutional.<span class="s5">15</span><span class="s6"> </span>Acting quickly to regain the upper hand, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (otherwise known as Gramm-Rudman- Hollings II). The bill took away most of the President’s deferral power, although it did provide for limited exceptions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">In 1988 the Air Force probed congressional appetite for enforcement of the law when it refused to spend</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$160,000 authorized by Congress to keep seven SR-71 Blackbird spy planes in flyable storage. The Service insisted the aging Cold War aircraft were too expensive to operate and were no longer needed because of the capabilities of spy satellites. The move went unchallenged, perhaps because the sum at stake was</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">relatively inconsequential. Five years later, Congress ordered the Blackbird out of retirement. The Air Force, which had</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">not budgeted for the aircraft, moved to ground the plane for a second time in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1996. The move coincided with a shift in the tug-of-war between Congress and the President back in favor of the executive. Congress enacted the Line Item Veto</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Act of 1996, which gave the President sweeping powers to veto individual items in appropriations bills unless Congress overrode the veto with a two-thirds vote in both houses.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The legislation was immediately chal- lenged by multiple lawsuits. One appeal reached the Supreme Court in 1997, but justices withheld ruling on the con- stitutionality of the act, choosing instead to dismiss the challenge on technical grounds.<span class="s5">16</span><span class="s6"> </span>During the legal wrangling,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">President Bill Clinton used his new power 82 times, including taking action to rescind $39 million allocated for the SR-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">71.<span class="s5">17</span><span class="s6"> </span>Finally in June 1998, the Supreme Court took up a second appeal (<span class="s11">Clinton</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s11">v. City of New York</span>) and struck down the law in a 6 to 3 decision.<span class="s5">18</span><span class="s6"> </span>In dissent,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, “There is not a dime’s worth of difference between</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Congress authorizing the president to cancel a spending item, and Congress’ authorizing money to be spent on a par- ticular item at the president’s discretion. And the latter has been done since the founding of the nation.”<span class="s5">19</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Supreme Court decision shifted the balance of power back in Congress’s favor, something that is not conducive to curing, to quote then-Senator and later Secretary of Defense William Cohen, “the presence and prevalence of trichino- sis in the halls of Congress.”<span class="s5">20</span><span class="s6"> </span>Congress’s refusal to cut public spending has led to sequestration, which mandates across- the-board defense spending cuts that no one believes make strategic sense.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">While dysfunction and a failure of political will to cut spending do not justify unconstitutional remedies such as the Line Item Veto Act, returning to a pre-1974 equilibrium where the President routinely exercises his judg- ment to trim defense pork would be advantageous for the Nation.<span class="s5">21</span><span class="s6"> </span>“To be</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">able to surgically remove wasteful spend- ing would be a service to the taxpayers,” remarked Cohen. “Every report about</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tion over appropriated funds. Indeed, the Supreme Court in its <span class="s11">Clinton v. City of New York </span>decision suggested that practice was within the bounds of the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Constitution.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Absent a legislative compromise, the President should pick an egregious</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">example of defense pork, perhaps the 280 M1 tanks slated for storage, and reassert his historic right. While the Supreme Court was not amenable to allowing Congress to vote to give the President broad line-item veto power, it may be less willing to infringe upon the President’s independent constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief and chief executive to block defense spending that is wasteful or strategically unsound.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Even if a limited Presidential authority emerges from this next round of tug-of- war, it would serve to lower the defense baseline every year. And as every saver knows, even small cuts over a long period can add up to considerable savings. More important, it may also instill behavioral changes that stave off bankruptcy and lead to a more stable financial future. <span class="s12">JFQ</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">from Spain and closed the port of New Orleans to American commerce.
