None of the passengers were injured, but they were forced to stay on the ship until Sunday, when a Canadian coast guard icebreaker arrived to ferry them to Kugluktuk.<span class="s5">1 </span>It took 3 days for the icebreaker to arrive. If the <span class="s4">Adventurer</span></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">began to sink in frigid waters, could the Canadian government have responded in time? If the same event occurred off the coast of Alaska, could the United States respond in time?</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Currently, the United States is not postured to handle the increase in human activity that is occurring in the Arctic.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Arctic capabilities of the United States are inadequate and action is re- quired in the near term—the next 5 to 7 years—to operate in this more accessible yet still challenging region. In the imme- diate future, the area of gravest concern is safety. In coming years, Arctic sovereignty claims, commercial shipping, resource ex- ploration, tourism, and increased military operations could drive multiple scenarios causing the region to become an arena</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of international cooperation, competi- tion, or conflict.<span class="s5">2</span><span class="s6"> </span>As greater accessibility and commercial development expand, national interest and an urgency to ensure that the United States possesses the ca- pacity to preserve freedom of navigation, provide safety of life at sea, protect its natural resources, and preserve the natu- ral environment will increase as well.<span class="s5">3</span><span class="s6"> </span>For these reasons, the United States should immediately invest in search and rescue (SAR) infrastructure and icebreakers to support future regional safety needs.</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Arctic sea ice melted to its lowest recorded level in 2012 and resulted in the opening both of previously inacces- sible parts of the Arctic Ocean and of economic exclusion zones (EEZs). The biggest driver for opening the Arctic</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is simple economics: trillions of dollars worth of resources could lie below newly accessible areas. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, nearly 13 percent of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the world’s undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered gas reserves are north of the Arctic Circle, a staggering 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.<span class="s5">4</span><span class="s6"> </span>Countries and corporations are postur-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ing themselves to tap into this enormous potential wealth of oil, gas, and minerals.

Even today’s relatively meager number of summer tourists cruising Arctic waters exceeds the limited emergency response capabilities of the local communities. Of most concern is the spatial compression of opportunity to successfully respond and conduct lifesaving operations. The Arctic’s cold air and water temperatures, shifting pack ice, and unpredictable weather require the quick and efficient rescue of tourists aboard lifeboats or dis- tressed vessels. Even limited exposure to cold weather and Arctic seawater reduce human endurance to minutes and the likelihood of long-term survival to nearly</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fully known, each of the Arctic nations is expending great effort to assess, access, and extract these resources.<span class="s5">10 </span>For example Alaska, by way of the Red Dog mine, produces 10 percent of the world’s zinc output.

From 2008 to 2012, U.S. Coast Guard Arctic Maritime Activity data show a 100 percent increase of traffic in the region from 123 vessels to 247.<span class="s5">5 </span>Though not a large numerical increase, it does demonstrate an upward trend. The increase in vessel traffic has height- ened the probability of incidents and potential casualties that would require Coast Guard medical response/evacu- ation or SAR support. Of significant concern, cruise ship traffic in the Arctic exponentially increases the aspect of safety and potential undesired conse- quences. In 2007 more than half of Alaska’s 1.7 million visitors were cruise ship passengers, and the economic impact of the tourist industry cannot be overstated. It provides a $1.07 billion economic benefit annually for the state and $767 million in direct industry spending. Despite the total</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cruise capacity in Alaska declining by 10 percent from 2009 to 2010, the indus- try experienced overall growth over the last 10 years. This trend is expected to continue.<span class="s5">6</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">As passenger and cruise vessels increase in number and routes stretch further into the Arctic, SAR infrastruc- ture and passenger safety requirements</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">zero.

The agreement is the first legally binding instrument negoti- ated under the auspices of the Arctic Council and the first legal accord on any topic among all eight Arctic states. The signing of the <span class="s4">Nuuk Declaration </span>demon- strates the commitment and cooperation to address emerging safety issues in the Arctic region. The agreement commits parties to provide appropriate assistance when incidents arise and to take other steps to address growing SAR require- ments in the Arctic region.<span class="s5">8</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Economic Drivers</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Shell Oil Company has already invested 6 years and $4.5 billion in an effort to tap into the oil reserves off the North Slope of Alaska.<span class="s5">9</span><span class="s6"> </span>The</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Geological Survey projects that a good portion of this undiscovered oil lies off the coast of Alaska, within the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. EEZ.

Furthermore, Naknek-King Salmon, another major Arctic fishing port, processed 105.2 million pounds of fish in 2008.

The Northern Sea Route along the Russian northern coast could reduce a maritime journey between East Asia and Western Europe from 21,000 kilometers (km) utilizing the Suez Canal to 12,800 km, cutting transit time by 10 to 15 days.<span class="s5">15</span><span class="s6"> </span>The summer of 2011 saw a record 33 ships carrying 850,000 tons of cargo navigating the Northern Sea Route off Russia’s northern coast. This year’s ship- ping season may see up to 1.5 million</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tons of cargo. The development of Arctic offshore hydrocarbon resources and related economic activities will also improve the integration of the Arctic economy into global trade patterns.<span class="s5">16</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">However, Stephen M. Carmel, senior vice president of Maersk Line, Limited, has questioned the viability of global Arctic transshipping. Carmel argues that Arctic shipping routes do not offer an attractive alternative to the more tradi- tional routes and are highly unlikely to be advantageous in the future. He believes the variability in transit time due to shifting ice and unpredictable weather is unacceptable in a world of “just in time” supply. He further notes that variability eliminates network efficiencies. Arctic routes are useful for only a small part of the year and are more expensive due to poor economies of scale.<span class="s5">17</span><span class="s6"> </span>Therefore, Carmel would not expect to see a large increase in commercial transit shipping.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Regardless of whether trans-Arctic shipment is slow to develop for reasons outlined by Carmel, the traffic support- ing the worldwide delivery of extracted resources <span class="s4">from </span>the Arctic is increasing dramatically.<span class="s5">18</span><span class="s6"> </span>Oil and gas developments in northern Russia have resulted in a higher demand for shipping to and from that area.

For example, if an MRO or large oil spill incident occurred on the North Slope of Alaska, the closest Federal SAR and oil spill response is 820 miles away in Kodiak. Current oil spill response capabilities include four Spilled Oil Recover Systems equipped on 225- foot buoy tenders home ported in Alaska at Kodiak, Sitka, Cordova, and Homer; an aerial dispersant delivery system staged in Anchorage as a backup to commercial venders; and Federal on-scene coordi- nators located in Juneau, Anchorage,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and Valdez with incident management expertise and limited prepositioned oil</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: center;">20</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">responsibilities in the maritime region of Alaska, including the North Pacific Ocean and the U.S. slice of the Arctic. Because Alaska is vast and remote, D17 relies on other government and civilian agencies for SAR missions. For example, the National Guard, U.S. Air Force, Alaska State Troopers, dozens of small fire departments and volunteer rescue organizations such as SAR Dogs, Civil Air Patrol, and Sitka Search and Rescue are important augmentation resources that ensure timely SAR coverage. Fur- thermore, in the far north, D17 relies on local North Slope Borough Bell 412SP helicopters and fixed-wing air- craft for SAR requirements.<span class="s5">21</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The nearest Coast Guard air station to the Arctic is in Kodiak and requires a 4-hour fixed-wing or 10-hour rotary-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">wing flight to support the most northern Alaskan population of Barrow, a distance of 820 miles.

During an interview in December 2012, Rear Admiral Thomas Ostebo com- mented that Barrow would be the ideal location for SAR: “Barrow is Alaska’s most northern and largest town [on the North Slope] and is centrally located</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the U.S. Arctic. It is also the center of power for corporate, tribal, and eco- nomics of the North Shore Borough making it the best location for invest- ment of SAR infrastructure.”<span class="s5">25</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Despite its advantages as a key location for SAR support assets, Barrow’s central North Slope position creates significant logistical challenges due to a limited</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">road network and port access. No roads link Barrow to the rest of Alaska, which prevents ground shipment of supplies, and the lack of a deep-water port requires extensive use of small landing craft and fuel barges to deliver supplies to the main- land. Given weather impacts, Barrow’s primary line of communication is by avia- tion from either Anchorage or Fairbanks. Today, supplies and equipment required to execute SAR missions are flown into Wiley Post–Will Rogers Airport, the new- est airport on the North Slope, serviced by Alaska Airlines. Lack of port facilities means that marine cargo bound for Barrow is transferred from barges offshore to landing craft. U.S. cutters can anchor 1,200 yards off Barrow in 30 feet of water to receive supplies and transfer person- nel by small boat, but the anchorage is exposed to weather from all directions.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barrow is also a destination for small cruise ships carrying as many as 400 passengers, who must also be ferried on small boats.<span class="s5">26</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">D17’s 2012 Arctic Shield exercise demonstrated Coast Guard ability to execute a seasonal SAR capability from the airport in Barrow. D17 staged two HH60 helicopters along with aviation and communication detachments from June through September during Shell’s drilling season. The operation was deemed a success because of the SAR proof of concept but also due to the robust and positive engagement plan and the partnership D17 fostered with the North Slope Borough communi- ties. Nevertheless, there were logistical</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">challenges with even this small footprint. For example, fuel for the HH60s had to be flown in using C-130s, but hanger and berthing facilities, while manageable, were subpar for the requirements.<span class="s5">27</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Another SAR location to consider is Prudhoe Bay. While half the size of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Barrow with approximately 2,000 people, many of whom are transient workers supporting oil facilities, Prudhoe Bay</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">has an interconnected road network and limited port infrastructure. However,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it is disadvantaged by being 200 miles east of Barrow, closer to the Canadian border, and farther from potential SAR events along the western Alaskan Arctic. Prudhoe Bay is the unofficial northern terminus of the Pan-American Highway, which was used during Arctic Shield 2012 to transport the Navy Supervisor of Salvage (SUPSALV) tactical oil spill response equipment. Its limited port fa- cilities allowed the SUPSALV equipment to be loaded onto a commercial barge and shipped to the exercise training site near Barrow. The limited port infrastruc- ture can only support small ships and barges with 6 to 8 feet of draft. Resupply of a Coast Guard cutter would require</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a helicopter from the public Deadhorse Airport or barge out to approximately 12 nautical miles (nm) where the vessels could safely anchor, much further than the 1,200 yards at Barrow.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Neither location is ideal to satisfy requirements without major investment, but the United States must be able to operate in this area to support tourism, shipping, and oil exploration and drill- ing. Barrow offers a central location that is critical to reducing the time-distance factor. Any enhancement of Barrow’s infrastructure will require coordina- tion with the North Slope Borough.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A seasonal SAR capability could be established—when the ice retreats in the summer—to cover oil exploration and drilling along with recreational and cruise vessels. It is possible the Coast Guard could lease facilities in Barrow to support aircraft maintenance, fuel stor-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">age, lodging, and command and control.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, even a small footprint places a significant burden on the local com- munity, where resources are expensive</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and supply is limited. If it is not possible to lease facilities because of the strain it places on the community, the United States should invest in commercial off- the-shelf expeditionary-type structures/ facilities similar to what the Department of Defense (DOD) used during Operations <span class="s4">Enduring Freedom </span>and <span class="s4">Iraqi Freedom</span>. Washington is not in a position to invest in major construction without further study, so temporary facilities make sense as a stopgap measure.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Another import consideration is refu- eling operations. Once on scene, maritime assets are limited both by fuel capacity and the distance to a refueling station. With the closest fueling point to Barrow nearly 1,000 nm away in Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Chain, on-station times are dramatically reduced. Even under ideal water conditions, the Coast Guard does not have the surface capacity to support sustained presence in the Arctic.<span class="s5">28</span><span class="s6"> </span>Ostebo identified one possible solution. Shell obtained a refueling barge that supported 22 maritime vessels during its oil explora- tion in the Chukchi Sea, and he believes</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a similar contract to support cutters and other ships is possible for future missions. On-station refueling would allow for sustained maritime presence in the Arctic Sea before returning to Dutch Harbor for resupply is required. Regarding air</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">platforms, once an adequate supply of avi- ation fuel is housed at Barrow, the Coast Guard can use the location to sustain air presence in the region.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Emerging Need for Additional Icebreakers</h2><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When issues begin to arise in the Arctic, the United States will need a maritime surface presence sufficient to support safety and response. Presence enables the Coast Guard to respond to vessels in distress, thus saving lives and protect- ing against potential pollution. Presence also ensures adequate enforcement of vessel routing regimes and compliance with safety, environmental laws, and treaties.<span class="s5">29 </span>To maintain a presence in</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Arctic, the United States needs an adequate number of icebreakers or ice- capable ships. Presently, there is only one operational surface ship capable of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">operating in ice. That ship, the USCGC <span class="s4">Healy</span>, is considered a medium ice- breaker capable of cutting through 4.5 feet of ice at 3 knots, and it has less than 20 years of service life remaining. The <span class="s4">Polar Star</span>, a heavy icebreaker commis- sioned in the 1970s, is capable of break- ing through 6 feet of ice. It recently finished a major refit and is undergoing sea trials. The <span class="s4">Polar Star </span>was expected to return to service in early 2013 with</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">6 to 7 years of remaining service life.<span class="s5">30 </span>The Coast Guard placed the <span class="s4">Polar Sea</span>, the sister ship of the <span class="s4">Polar Star</span>, in “commissioned but inactive” status October 14, 2011, because of a blown</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">engine.<span class="s5">31 </span>For comparison, Russia has up to 25 icebreakers, and several nuclear- powered icebreakers can cut through ice 6 to 9 feet thick. China is building an icebreaker for launch in 2014. This will be China’s second—it purchased its first from Ukraine in 1993.<span class="s5">32</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Since September 2010, at least three reports have identified the Coast Guard’s challenges in meeting its current and future icebreaking mission requirements in the Arctic, as well as the hurdles it faces in acquiring new icebreakers.<span class="s5">33</span><span class="s6"> </span>A January 2011 report from the DHS Office of the Inspector General noted that the Coast Guard and other U.S. agencies are un- able to meet their current Arctic mission requirements with existing icebreaking resources. The report highlighted that Coast Guard resources are unlikely to meet future demands as well, in part because the agency has not followed its life-cycle replacement plan, which requires replacement of icebreaking ships after 30 years of service. The report concluded that without funding for new icebreakers or major service-life extensions of existing vessels, the United States would lose all of its polar icebreaking capabilities by 2029.<span class="s5">34</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Sent to Congress in October 2011, the <span class="s4">U.S. Polar Icebreaker Recapitalization Report </span>addressed recapitalization of U.S. polar icebreakers. The report addressed ways to meet mission requirements by assessing options for rehabilitating the icebreaker fleet including new icebreaker construction, refurbishment of <span class="s4">Polar Sea </span>or <span class="s4">Polar Star</span>, and leasing. The report found that the most cost-effective option</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">would be to build two heavy icebreakers while performing minimal maintenance to keep the existing icebreakers opera- tional. Given the timeframe associated with building new ships, the report con- cluded that the Coast Guard must begin planning and budgeting immediately.<span class="s5">35</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">A third report, <span class="s4">The High Latitude Study</span>, included a broader analysis of the Coast Guard’s icebreaker needs. Presented to Congress in July 2011, the report found that the common, dominant contributor to the significant mission effects in the Arctic is a gap in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">polar icebreaking capability, and that the existing icebreaker fleet is insufficient to meet the Coast Guard’s statutory mission requirements in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. To fulfill these mission require- ments, the study found that the Service needs a minimum of six icebreakers (three heavy and three medium). If the requirements for a U.S. Navy presence are taken into account, the Coast Guard would require three additional heavy icebreakers and one additional medium icebreaker, for a total of 10 icebreakers.<span class="s5">36</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The Coast Guard estimates it will take 8 to 10 years to design and build a new icebreaker. It is projected that it will cost</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$859 million to construct a new <span class="s4">Polar</span>- class heavy icebreaker and $1.2 billion to reconstruct the <span class="s4">Polar Sea </span>or <span class="s4">Polar Star </span>from scratch to the current standard for heavy icebreakers.<span class="s5">37</span><span class="s6"> </span>Other options include leasing icebreakers or jointly funding icebreakers through the National Science Foundation (NSF) or DOD. Currently, these options do not appear viable. DOD is working through its own budget con- straints. Using the NSF is possible, but</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it might pull the icebreaker away from its primary missions to support scientific</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">research. Lastly, there have been bad expe- riences with leased icebreakers that could not fulfill their mission requirements.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sweden called the <span class="s4">Oden </span>home, breaking its commitment by ending its resupply and science mission support of the U.S. Antarctic McMurdo Research Station and putting the entire 2011–2012 research season in jeopardy. The NSF was eventu- ally able to commission a Russian vessel.<span class="s5">38</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The good news is that the Coast Guard budget includes $8 million in</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">acquisition funding to initiate survey and design activities for a new polar icebreaker. The Coast Guard’s Five Year Capital Investment Plan includes an additional $852 million in fiscal years (FY) 2014–2017 for acquiring the ship. The Coast Guard anticipates awarding a construction contract within the next 5</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">years and taking delivery within a decade, just as <span class="s4">Polar Sea </span>retires. The project to design and build a polar icebreaker is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a new acquisition project initiated in the FY13 budget.<span class="s5">39</span><span class="s6"> </span>The next step is for Congress to act on the Coast Guard’s budget to modernize its icebreaker fleet so it has the capability to perform its</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">polar missions. Construction of this new icebreaker will still only give the Coast Guard two operational icebreakers after 2020, when the <span class="s4">Polar Star </span>meets the end of its service-life extension.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The <span class="s4">High Latitude Report </span>listed a re- quirement of up to six icebreakers to meet statutory requirements into the future.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That number may be what is required in the far term, but near-term requirements suggest that the United States needs a minimum of three icebreakers to support the following missions:</p></li><li style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Antarctica Presence—scientific research and McMurdo resupply</p></li><li style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Arctic Presence—enforcement of vessel routing regimes, compliance with safety, security, and environ- mental laws/treaties, freedom of navigation, response to vessels in distress, SAR, protecting against potential pollution</p></li><li style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Arctic Research/Thule Air Force Base resupply/Flex—support to the NSF, resupply of Thule, and an</p></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">option to flex to any location in case a crisis or emergency arises.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Deciding to keep the U.S. icebreaker fleet “status quo” in the near term would risk response capability for incidents in the Arctic and place the United States at a strategic disadvantage vis-à-vis other countries that are committed to increas- ing their role in the Arctic. Washington needs to start building two icebreakers to fill this need immediately because the</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Polar Star <span class="p">service life is extended to 2020 and the </span>Healy <span class="p">to 2030.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The United States needs to take steps now to invest in Arctic safety capabilities to operate in a more accessible region as human activity in that region increases. The Coast Guard is currently not funded to handle statutory missions to support this increase in activity. To boost national Arctic capabilities to protect and promote</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. interests, Congress must ensure that the Coast Guard is funded appropriately. Investing in a seasonal search-and-rescue location in Barrow, Alaska, and building two additional icebreakers would allow the Nation to have a near-term Arctic presence and protect its safety interests. Not investing in these Arctic safety ca- pabilities in the near term would risk the ability of the United States to respond to incidents and possibly save lives or pre- vent environmental catastrophe. <span class="h4">JFQ</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="216" height="1" alt="image" src="jfq-72_82-87_Roscoe-Campagna-McNulty/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: justify;">1 <span class="s9">CBC News North, available at &lt;www.cbc. ca/news/canada/north/story/2010/08/30/ arctic-ship-stranded-home.html&gt;.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8">2</span><span class="s10"> </span>Ronald O’Rourke, <span class="s11">Changes in the Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress</span>, R41153 (Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, October 8, 2010).</p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;">3<span class="s10"> </span><a href="http://www.uscg.mil/directives/" class="a" target="_blank">United States Coast Guard (USCG), Commandant Instruction 16003.1, “U.S. Coast Guard Arctic Strategic Approach,” April 26, 2011, available at </a><span class="s9">&lt;www.uscg.mil/directives/ ci/16000-16999/CI_16003_1.pdf&gt;.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">4 <a href="http://money.cnn/" class="a" target="_blank">Steve Hargreaves, “Oil: Only Part of the Arctic’s Massive Resource,” CNN Money, July </a><span class="s9">19, 2012, available at &lt;http://money.cnn. com/2012/07/17/news/economy/Arctic- oil/index.htm&gt;.</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8">5</span><span class="s10"> </span>U.S. Committee on the Maritime Trans- portation System (CMTS), <span class="s11">U.S. Arctic Marine Transportation System: Overview and Priorities for Action </span><a href="http://www.cmts.gov/downloads/CMTS_" class="a" target="_blank">(Washington, DC: Department of Transportation, February 2013), 23, figure 5, available at </a>&lt;www.cmts.gov/downloads/CMTS_ Draft_Arctic_MTS_Overview_and_Priorities_Pa- per_for_Public_Comment-Feb2013.pdf&gt;.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8">6</span><span class="s10"> </span>Gene Sloan, “New Alaska Law Brings Steep Drop to Taxes on Cruise Ship Passengers,” <span class="s11">USA Today</span><a href="http://travel/" class="a" target="_blank">, June 6, 2010, available at </a>&lt;http://travel. usatoday.com/cruises/post/2010/06/new- alaska-law-brings-steep-drop-to-tax-on-cruise- ship-passengers/97927/1&gt;.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8">7</span><span class="s10"> </span>Arctic Council, Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment working group, <span class="s11">Arctic Ma- rine Shipping Assessment 2009 </span>(Tromsø, Norway: Arctic Council 6<span class="s8">th</span><span class="s10"> </span><a href="http://www.pame.is/amsa-2009-report" class="a" target="_blank">Ministerial Meeting, 2009), available at </a>&lt;www.pame.is/amsa-2009-report&gt;.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">8 <span class="s9">Arctic Council, Agreement on Coopera-</span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tion on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic (Nuuk, Greenland: Arctic Council 7<span class="s8">th</span><span class="s10"> </span><a href="http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/" class="a" target="_blank">Ministerial Meeting, May 12, 2011), available at </a>&lt;www.arctic-council.org/index.php/ en/environment-and-people/oceans/search- and-rescue/157-sar-agreement&gt;.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8">9</span><span class="s10"> </span>Clifford Krauss, “Shell Delays Arctic Oil Drilling until 2013,” <span class="s11">The New York Times</span><a href="http://www/" class="a" target="_blank">, September 17, 2012, available at </a>&lt;www. nytimes.com/2012/09/18/business/global/ shell-delays-arctic-oil-drilling-until-next-year. html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&gt;.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s8">10</span><span class="s10"> </span>Heather A.
