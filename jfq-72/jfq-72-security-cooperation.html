White</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The term <span class="s3">nation assistance </span>is not often used in policy or strategy. For example, the current National Security Strategy mentions foreign assistance three times but does not use the term <span class="s3">nation assis- tance</span>. The first opportunity to create some clarity is to replace the term <span class="s3">nation assistance </span>with <span class="s3">foreign assistance </span>in the upcoming revisions of JP 3-0, <span class="s3">Joint Operations</span>, and JP 3-22, <span class="s3">Foreign</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">D</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">epartment of Defense (DOD) security cooperation activities support or are combined with</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">other assistance programs and often are a part of nation assistance. This often occurs in a manner that may appear confusing or convoluted to the joint warfighter. This article portrays how the programs and activities converge. Although the various terms and activi- ties in show in the accompanying figure appear to have simple names and mean- ings, they in fact have strict definitions based on funding and authorities. While some of the activities directly support one another, others have distinct boundaries between their definitions and functions. The joint community</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is beginning to address the framework of security cooperation in a new joint doctrine publication, Joint Publication (JP) 3-XX, <span class="s3">Security Cooperation</span>. It is important to embark with clear defini- tions and understanding of the complex relationship among these terms to facili- tate understanding by the joint force.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Security cooperation is referred to in both joint professional military educa- tion programs and joint staffs as a tool to be employed by combatant commands.</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, in other settings, it is a set of programs managed by the Defense</p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Security Cooperation Agency. Extensive review of joint doctrine and policy reveals that the definition of <span class="s3">security cooperation </span>appears to encompass these areas and more. After expanding our understanding of security cooperation, other terms such as <span class="s3">security force assistance</span>, <span class="s3">foreign internal defense</span>, and <span class="s3">security assistance </span>provide additional specificity for the tasks being</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">conducted, yet some of these actions fall outside security cooperation. Even though security cooperation spans the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">range of military operations and is inclu- sive of large-scale operations conducted in support of foreign nations, it is not all- encompassing of security related support from U.S. agencies other than DOD.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s3">Nation assistance </span>is support rendered by foreign forces within another nation’s territory based on mutual agreements.<span class="s5">1</span><span class="s6"> </span>While this term is used to describe the comprehensive approach to assisting other nations, the definition associated with <span class="s3">nation assistance </span>has two limita- tions: it does not encompass support to regional organizations, and it is only assis- tance by foreign forces. A better, broader term is <span class="s3">foreign assistance</span>, which is assis- tance to foreign nations ranging from the sale of military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid survivors of natural and manmade disasters.<span class="s5">2</span><span class="s6"> </span>When examining the current definitions for <span class="s3">for- eign assistance </span>and <span class="s3">nation assistance</span>, we find significant overlap:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Foreign assistance to foreign nations <span class="p">[ranges] </span>from the sale of military equip- ment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid survivors of natural and man-made disasters. U.S. foreign as- sistance takes three forms: development assistance, humanitarian assistance, and security assistance.<span class="s5">3</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This term is likely to resonate with the State Department, which has an Office of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Foreign Assistance and a designated foreign assistance budget.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nation assistance<span class="h3">—</span>assistance rendered</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Internal Defense<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">If foreign assistance were to replace nation assistance in joint doctrine, the definition would include that portion of security cooperation that falls outside</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the realm of nation assistance in figure 1. Foreign assistance then encompasses all of security cooperation and reduces some of the ambiguity. Security cooperation then focuses strictly on the DOD contribution to foreign assistance and encompasses all DOD interactions with foreign defense establishments to build both national</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and regional defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests, develop allied and friendly military capa- bilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to host nations.<span class="s5">5</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Having addressed the larger con- structs, it is possible to review and clarify the relationships between other programs and activities that occur within them.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First is <span class="s3">security assistance </span>with a specific definition in relation to both DOD and State. It refers to a group of programs au- thorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">These programs are funded and autho- rized by State to be administered by DOD through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.<span class="s5">6</span><span class="s6"> </span>This is the process by which the United States provides de- fense articles, military training, and other defense-related services. That portion</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of security assistance outside of security cooperation in figure 1 reflects State and other civilian agency involvement.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Foreign internal defense<span class="p">, one of the 11 core activities of special operations, is</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">                                                                  <span class="s3">     to a nation by foreign forces within that</span></p><p style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">frequently thought of as only small en-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">Major Taylor P.

Security force assistance is</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the “participation by a foreign govern- ment in any of the programs taken by a host nation to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency, terrorism, and other threats to its secu- rity.”<span class="s5">7</span><span class="s6"> </span>It encompasses involvement in</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the internal defense of a host nation by both civilian and military agencies. As long as there is an internal threat to the host nation, any support provided by the United States to that nation falls under the definition of <span class="s3">foreign internal defense</span>. Large-scale U.S. counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and counterdrug op- erations conducted in support of a host nation are just as much foreign internal defense as using special operations forces to train and advise foreign security forces.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">This range of support to a host nation is captured in the three categories of for- eign internal defense. The first is indirect support, with emphasis on strengthening national institutions through economic and military capabilities that contribute to self-sufficiency. The overlap of security assistance and indirect support in figure</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 reflects State Department–funded programs administered by DOD, which provides training and/or equipment to a foreign nation facing an internal threat to its security. Second is direct support, involving everything short of combat operations that provides direct military assistance to the host nation civilian</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">populace or military when it is faced with a threat beyond its capabilities. This sup- port does not overlap security assistance in figure 1 because these activities involve the employment of the joint force in</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a supporting role, are joint or Service funded, and do not involve the transfer of arms or equipment. This support is typically in the form of logistics and intel- ligence support to the host nation. The final category of foreign internal defense</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is U.S. combat operations and is meant to serve only as a stopgap measure until host nation security forces are able to provide security for the population. This includes major operations against internal threats but remains strategically defensive in nature. Although not widely recognized as such, the United States conducted for- eign internal defense campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan after the establishment of the host nation governments.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">All three categories of foreign internal defense can take place simultaneously, with security assistance programs provid- ing funding and equipment to the host nation (indirect support), intelligence- sharing with the ministry of defense (direct support), and American forces conducting large-scale counterinsurgency operations (combat operations). The level of U.S. involvement is driven by the po- litical decisions of its elected leaders, the host nation’s capability and capacity, and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DOD’s contribution to a unified action effort to support and augment the de- velopment of the capacity and capability of foreign security forces and their sup- porting institutions toward achievement of specific objectives shared by the U.S.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Government.<span class="s5">8</span><span class="s6"> </span>The approaches used by the joint force to build relationships</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and promote U.S. security interests vary widely from country to country.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Some U.S. partners already possess extensive security capability (qualitative) and capacity (quantitative), and it is im- portant to develop interoperability with these partners through bilateral exercises and military-to-military exchange and education. Other partners’ security forces benefit from security force assistance that focuses on the sustainable development of the foreign security forces’ capabilities and capacities. These efforts represent only DOD activities, but they can be applied to all types of security forces and supporting institutions. Defense minis- tries and training institutions can be the target of security force assistance as well as local police and border patrol forces. These activities include organizing, train- ing, equipping, rebuilding and building, and advising and assisting, but they must be conducted with, through, and by the foreign security forces.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">As security force assistance is only a DOD activity, it remains fully inside the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="679" height="1" alt="image" src="jfq-72_106-108_White/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">JFQ 72, 1<span class="s10">st </span>Quarter 2014 <b>White </b><span class="s12">107</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">realm of security cooperation in figure 1. A portion of <span class="s3">security force assistance </span>falls out- side of the definition of <span class="s3">nation assistance</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the figure because the United States can provide security force assistance to regional organizations such as the African Union (another instance where <span class="s3">foreign</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">assistance <span class="p">should replace </span>nation assistance<span class="p">). As shown in figure 1, some security force assistance activities are funded by security assistance programs, but only those that contribute to the sustainable capacity</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and capability of the host nation security forces. Some international military sales involve subsequent military training on the operation and maintenance of the equip- ment. While selling equipment does not constitute <span class="s3">security force assistance</span>, some subsequent military training on the equip- ment would fit into its definition.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Security force assistance is a primary tool to support partner nations when an internal threat is present. When the United States conducts indirect and direct support foreign internal defense, security force assistance is the means to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bolster the host nation’s efforts to coun- ter internal threats. These security force assistance activities must be conducted with, through, and then ultimately by the host nation’s forces, never as a substi- tute. The employment of U.S. forces in combat operations is a separate category of foreign internal defense and does not directly improve the capability or capacity of the host nation’s forces. U.S. combat operations establish the time and space necessary to develop a host nation’s</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ways as they guide the employment of the joint force toward a common objec- tive and the desired endstate. Security assistance programs and security force as- sistance activities are part of the means in an ends-ways-means methodology.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Successful National Security Strategy, supported by foreign assistance and se- curity cooperation, typically encourages a whole-of-government approach using all</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. Government instruments of national power. This approach is supported by the joint force through interagency coordina- tion. A more comprehensive approach designated as <span class="s3">unified action </span>integrates activities of the military, other interagency partners, multinational partners, and intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations for unity of effort by all participants in a given activity, opera- tion, or campaign. Much thought must be put into what type of foreign forces</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">we are supporting or enabling. Equal thought must be placed on the strategic endstate for the security cooperation and foreign assistance efforts supported by the United States and the future use for the foreign security forces the Nation is supporting. Washington cannot expect to create foreign forces in its own image; the history and culture of the host nation</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">must define the organization and ethos of its security forces. We must also take the nature of the threat and the operational environment into account when training and equipping foreign forces. Not all partners will fight wars of proxy for the United States. Instead they will use their</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">principles that guide the employment of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. forces in coordinated action toward a common objective. It is important for future joint doctrine to define and explain the relationship of security cooperation terms to facilitate understanding by the joint force.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">JP 3-XX, <span class="s3">Security Cooperation</span>, is ex- pected to address the many related terms and programs that support our nation’s foreign policy. This emerging doctrine must refrain from forcing the security related topics into a hierarchal relation- ship. It must explain the supporting relationships while properly defining the ends, ways, and means of employing the joint force in support of security coopera- tion activities and related joint operations (for example, foreign internal defense).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The future revision of JP 3-22, <span class="s3">Foreign Internal Defense</span>, should be synchronized with the development of JP 3-XX, while also expanding the discussion of the third category of foreign internal defense, U.S. combat operations, to consider large-scale counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations conducted in support of a host nation. Joint Doctrine Note 1-13,</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Security Force Assistance<span class="p">, will also assist the joint force commander in identifying tools and resources for assisting foreign forces.
