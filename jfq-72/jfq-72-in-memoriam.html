During the Korean War, General Jones flew more than 300 hours on combat missions against North Korea. In 1969, he served in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Republic of Vietnam as Deputy Commander for Operations and then as Vice Commander of the Seventh Air Force.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">In August 1971, General Jones assumed command of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force, was promoted to general in September, and led the way toward establishing the integrated air headquarters in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Central Region, Allied Air Forces Central Europe.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">General Jones became Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force in July 1974 and was responsible for administering, training, and equipping a worldwide organization of men and women employing the world’s most advanced defense systems.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">On June 21, 1978, General Jones was appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

This prompted the most active debate on organizational issues in defense since the 1950s when President Eisenhower proposed to strengthen the joint system.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">At the time of his retirement, General Jones’s 8 years as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—4 as Air Force Chief and 4 as Chairman—were the longest in history, and uniquely he served four different Presidents and four different Secretaries of Defense during that time.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">A graduate of the National War College in 1960, General Jones was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters degree from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1974, an honorary doctorate of laws degree from Louisiana Tech University in 1975, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters degree from Minot State College in 1979.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="679" height="1" alt="image" src="jfq-72_2-3_Letter/Image_003.png"/></span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">JFQ 72, 1<span class="s6">st </span>Quarter 2014 <b>Dialogue </b><span class="s11">3</span></p>
